In this study, we used a remote autonomous unbaited video system and recorded reef fish assemblages during daylight hours, 10 times a day for 34 consecutive days in a branching coral patch of the lagoon of New Caledonia. In total, 50031 fish observations belonging to 114 taxa, 66 genera and 31 families were recorded in 256 recorded videos. Carnivores and herbivore-detritus feeders dominated the trophic structure. We found significant variations in the composition of fish assemblages between times of day. Taxa richness and fish abundance were greater in the early morning and in the late afternoon than during the day. Fourteen taxa displayed well-defined temporal patterns in abundance with one taxon influenced by time of day, six influenced by tidal state and seven influenced by both time of day and tidal state. None of these 14 taxa were piscivores, 10 were herbivore-detritus feeders, three were carnivores and one was plankton feeder. Our results suggest a diel migration from feeding grounds to shelter areas and highlight the importance of taking into account small-scale temporal variability in animal diversity and abundance when studying connectivity between habitats and monitoring communities.","[Mallet, Delphine; Pelletier, Dominique] IFREMER, Unite Rech Lagons Ecosyst & Aquaculture Durable N, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Mallet, Delphine; Wantiez, Laurent] Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, EA LIVE 4243, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Vigliola, Laurent] IRD, UMR ENTROPIE, Lab Excellence LABEX Corail, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Pelletier, Dominique] Lab Excellence LABEX Corail, Perpignan, France",Ifremer; Universite Nouvelle Caledonie; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Mallet, D (corresponding author), IFREMER, Unite Rech Lagons Ecosyst & Aquaculture Durable N, Noumea, New Caledonia.;Mallet, D (corresponding author), Univ Nouvelle Caledonie, EA LIVE 4243, Noumea, New Caledonia.",delphine.mallet@yahoo.fr,"Pelletier, Dominique/JAO-0109-2023; Vigliola, Laurent/J-7107-2016; Wantiez, Laurent/L-3343-2013","Vigliola, Laurent/0000-0003-4715-7470; Wantiez, Laurent/0000-0001-5024-2057; Mallet, Delphine/0000-0002-7636-6450; Pelletier, Dominique/0000-0003-2420-1942",IFREMER; Agence des Aires Marines Protegees; Conservatoire des Espaces Naturels de Nouvelle-Caledonie; Province of New Caledonia; Government of New Caledonia,IFREMER; Agence des Aires Marines Protegees; Conservatoire des Espaces Naturels de Nouvelle-Caledonie; Province of New Caledonia; Government of New Caledonia,"We thank Charles Gonson, Thierry Laugier from the French Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) and Olivier Demerge (taxi-boat) for assistance at sea.

Mortality on coral reefs is intrinsically linked with predation, with most evidence suggesting that predation is highest during crepuscular periods. We tested this hypothesis using passive acoustic telemetry data to determine the time of day of potential mortality events (PMEs) of adult herbivorous reef fishes. A total of 94 fishes were tagged with acoustic transmitters, of which 43 exhibited a PME. Furthermore, we identified five categories of PMEs based on the nature of change in acoustic signal detections from tagged fishes. The majority of PMEs were characterised by an abrupt stop in detections, possibly as a result of a large, mobile predator. Overall, mortality rates were estimated to be approximately 59 % per year using passive acoustic telemetry. The time of day of PMEs suggests that predation was highest during the day and crepuscular periods and lowest at night, offering only partial support for the crepuscular predation hypothesis. Visually oriented, diurnal and crepuscular predators appear to be more important than their nocturnal counterparts in terms of predation on adult reef fishes. By timing PMEs, passive acoustic telemetry may offer an important new tool for investigating the nature of predation on coral reefs.","[Khan, J. A.; Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

To improve this situation for reef fishes, we introduced a novel response variable method that treats signal detections as proportions (i.e., percent transmissions detected or detection rates) and compared this against prior approaches to examine the influence of array and transmitter performance, signal distance and environmental factors on detection rates. We applied this method to tagged snappers and groupers in the Florida reef ecosystem and controlled range-tests on static targets in Bayboro Harbor, Florida, to provide methodological guidance for the planning and evaluation of passive array studies for coral reef fishes. Results: Logistic regression analysis indicated detection rates were primarily a non-linear function of tag distance from receiver. A 'model-weighted' function was developed to incorporate the non-linear relationship between detection rate and distance to provide robust positioning estimates and allow for easy extension to tags with different ping rates. Conclusions: Optimal acoustic array design requires balancing the interplay between receiver spacing, detection rates, and positioning error. Spacing receivers at twice the distance of the modeled 50% detection rate may be appropriate when quantification of overall space use is a priority, and would provide a minimum of 75% detection rate. However, for research where missing detections within the array is unacceptable or time-at-arrival based fine-scale positioning is needed, tighter receiver spacing may be required to maintain signal detection probability near 100%.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.; Smith, Steven G.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Franklin, Erik/ABC-1088-2020; Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007; Franklin, Erik/0000-0002-8660-3085",National Park Service [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grant [NA17RJ1226]; American Society for Engineering Education's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Glenda Kelley; Scott Donahue; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; United States Geological Survey; Stock Island Oceanside Marina,National Park Service; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); American Society for Engineering Education's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Glenda Kelley; Scott Donahue; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Stock Island Oceanside Marina,"The authors thank Dry Tortugas National Park; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary; the captains of Andy Griffiths Charters of Key West, Florida; D.B.

Movements of ultrasonic tagged reef fish were determined using a calibrated array of omnidirectional hydroacoustic receivers. Average home range sizes were 2.09 +/- 0.39 km(2) (n = 28; total length, TL = 45 to 66 cm) for red grouper Epinephelus morio, 4.17 +/- 1.75 km(2) (n = 5, TL = 48 to 55 cm) for yellowtail snapper Ocyurus chrysurus, 1.44 +/- 1.04 km(2) (n = 2, TL = 57 to 75 cm) for black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci, and 7.64 km(2) (n = 1, TL = 70 cm) for mutton snapper Lutjanus analis. Red grouper and yellowtail snapper moved moderate distances (from 700 to 900 m) with moderate frequency. Observed movements for black groupers were relatively small and infrequent. Mutton snappers appeared to make short, frequent movements. A tracked gray snapper L. griseus made long-distance nocturnal migrations. Several exploited-phase groupers and snappers crossed into and out of reserve boundaries. They were most likely to do so in locations where boundaries were positioned over contiguous coral reef and close to home-range centers. We found that home ranges for red grouper, black grouper, and yellowtail snapper were relatively small in comparison to NTMR area. Our observations suggest that the Dry Tortugas NTMRs may reduce exposure to exploitation for these and other species with limited home ranges, especially where NTMR boundaries do not overlie contiguous reef.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SE Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007","National Park Service CESU [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation [NA17RJ1226, NA08OAR4320892]; ASEE National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship",National Park Service CESU; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); ASEE National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship,"This research was supported by National Park Service CESU contract H5000065040-J5281060165 and NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grants NA17RJ1226 and NA08OAR4320892.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness.","[Pittman, Simon J.; Monaco, Mark E.; Kendall, Matthew S.; Poti, Matthew; Clark, Randall D.; Wedding, Lisa M.; Caldow, Chris] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.; Legare, Bryan; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Islands, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Plymouth, Ctr Marine & Coastal Policy Res, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Texas Parks & Wildlife, Dickinson Marine Lab, Dickinson, TX USA; [Wedding, Lisa M.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Woods Inst Environm, Monterey, CA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands; University of Plymouth; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Stanford University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Wedding, Lisa/GRY-3972-2022","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [0814417]; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-31-1-06]; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy [NA09NMF4270068]; NOAA [NA08NOS4260348]; USGS State Partnership Program [07ERAG0078]; Office Of The Director; EPSCoR [0814417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USGS State Partnership Program; Office Of The Director; EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"SJP, MEM, AMF and LMW were supported by U.S. National Park Service, NOAA Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA) and NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program.

Commonly used statistical home range models, such as minimum convex polygon (MCP) or 95% kernel density (95% KD) methods, require the exclusion of individuals who move beyond the bounds of the tracking study. Spatially explicit individual-based models of fish home range movements parameterized from multiple years of acoustic tracking data were developed for three exploited coral reef fishes (red grouper Epinephelus morio, black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci, and mutton snapper Lutjanus analis) in Dry Tortugas, Florida. Movements were characterized as a combination of probability of movement, distance moved, and turning angle. Simulations suggested that the limited temporal and geographic scope of most movement studies may underestimate home range size, especially for fish with home range centers near the edges of the array. Simulations provided useful upper bounds for home range size (red grouper: 2.28 +/- 0.81 km(2) MCP, 3.60 +/- 0.89 km(2) KD; black grouper: 2.06 +/- 0.84 km(2) MCP, 3.93 +/- 1.22 km(2) KD; mutton snapper: 7.72 +/- 2.23 km(2) MCP, 6.16 +/- 1.11 km(2) KD). Simulations also suggested that MCP home ranges are more robust to artifacts of passive array acoustic detection patterns than 95% KD methods.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA, Sustainable Fisheries Div, Southeast Reg Off, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007","National Park Service CESU [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA17RJ1226, NA08OAR4320892]; National Science Foundation [EAR 1204752]; ASEE National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences [1204752] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Park Service CESU; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ASEE National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Earth Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"This research was supported by National Park Service CESU Contract H5000065040-J5281060165 and NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grants NA17RJ1226 and NA08OAR4320892.

Impacts on fish are uncertain. Opportunistic monitoring of acoustic signatures from a seismic survey on the inner continental shelf of North Carolina, USA, revealed noise exceeding 170 dB re 1 mu Pa peak on two temperate reefs federally designated as Essential Fish Habitat 0.7 and 6.5 km from the survey ship path. Videos recorded fish abundance and behavior on a nearby third reef 7.9 km from the seismic track. During seismic surveying, reef-fish abundance declined by 78% during evening hours when fish habitat use was highest on the previous three days without seismic noise. Despite absence of videos documenting fish returns after seismic surveying, the significant reduction in fish occtipation of the reef represents disruption to daily pattern. This numerical response confirms that conservation concerns associated with seismic surveying are realistic.","[Paxton, Avery B.; Voss, Christine M.; Peterson, Charles H.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC 27514 USA; [Paxton, Avery B.; Peterson, Charles H.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Biol, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Taylor, J.

Scientists and managers have sought to understand the effects of artificial reefs on reef fish ecology by focusing on fish residency and movement at artificial reefs with less attention paid to broader spatial and temporal patterns in reef fish movements among a seascape of artificial reefs and other natural habitats. We used novel large-scale (> 15 km(2)) geopositioning acoustic telemetry arrays to track the 3-dimensional movements of tagged red snapper (n = 59) and gray triggerfish (n = 15) among multiple nGOM artificial reefs up to 333 days. Tagged fish moved frequently among artificial reefs and had shorter residence times at the release reef (43 days for red snapper and 3 days for gray triggerfish) than reported in previous studies. Both species displayed high individual variability in movement dynamics, as well as seasonally variable diel patterns of habitat use, height above bottom, and distance to reefs, which may have been driven by dynamic influences of predation risk, physiological constraints, or foraging over time and space. The wider seascape view revealed in this study demonstrates the importance of including multiple artificial reefs over long timescales to capture individual, spatial, and temporal variability in reef fish movement.","[Bohaboy, Erin C.; Patterson, William F.

However, most studies have focused on the diurnal component of these aspects; nocturnal patterns are less known. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing diel movement patterns in ecologically and commercially important nocturnal coral reef fishes. We evaluate 122-days of acoustic telemetry data from 4 nocturnal species in 2 coral reef fish families (Haemulidae and Lutjanidae) on the Great Barrier Reef. For all species, we found a clear division between daytime resting areas on the reef and a move towards off-reef areas at night. This was highlighted in the low number of detections at night and the high average transitions between receivers at twilight. Over our study period, average nocturnal space use area (minimum convex polygon) of Plectorhincus gibbosus was 328,089 m2, Plectorhincus lineatus 28,828 m2, and Lutjanus carponotatus 20,369 m2. However, results from a Principal Component Analysis revealed that space use, and movement, varied substantially within species; for 3 of the 4 species the main axis of variation correlated with individual-level behaviour. These large differences in individual space use patterns highlight the need for caution when using species averages when considering ecosystem functions. Overall, our preliminary observations provide a glimpse into the large spatial extent, potential habitat connectivity, and intra and interspecific variation in activity patterns among large nocturnal Indo-Pacific reef fishes. This highlights their potential importance in maintaining ecosystem links between coral reefs and adjacent habitats.","[Collins, William P.; Bellwood, David R.; Morais, Renato A.; Siqueira, Alexandre C.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Morais, Renato A.] Univ Paris Sci & Lettres, CRIOBE, UAR3278, Perpignan, France; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Data Technol Hub, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TropWATER, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Siqueira, Alexandre C.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Sch Sci, Perth, WA, Australia",James Cook University; Universite PSL; James Cook University; James Cook University; Edith Cowan University,"Collins, WP (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",william.collins@my.jcu.edu.au,"Siqueira, Alexandre/AAJ-5987-2020; Araujo, Renato/AAA-7903-2021; Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011","Collins, William/0000-0001-8390-6526; Waltham, Nathan/0000-0003-0058-773X; Siqueira, Alexandre C./0000-0001-7970-4024","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council [CE140100020, FL190100062]; Australian Research Council (DRB); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council (DRB)(Australian Research Council); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","We thank Joanna A.

Data showed that the harlequin fish is a site-attached, diurnal predator, with a relatively small home range in comparison with other temperate reef fishes from Australia and New Zealand. These characteristics indicate that the harlequin fish is susceptible to localised depletions from fishing, but that it can be protected within no-take marine protected areas and can be detected with appropriate daytime monitoring techniques. Individuals also displayed discrete depth preferences on the reef slope, evidence of a nocturnal home base, and homing ability following disturbance from an extreme storm event.","[Bryars, S.] Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, Adelaide, Australia; [Rogers, P.

We used acoustic telemetry to study the activity of 19 deepwater grouper after a recompressed release with a descender device, achieved by rapidly returning fish to a depth where expanded gases can contract. The species tested were the Scamp Mycteroperca phenax (n=8), Snowy Grouper Hyporthodus niveatus (n=7), and Speckled Hind Epinephelus drummondhayi (n=4). Individuals of all three species showed post-recompression variation in water depth and acceleration indicative of survival, whereas information from other tags indicated discard mortality. Nonparametric Kaplan-Meier survivorship procedures yielded a 14-d survival estimate of 0.50 (95% confidence interval=0.10-0.91); although low, this estimate is higher than the currently assumed 0% survival. Additionally, our estimate of discard survival is likely biased low because we assumed that no individuals shed their tag, which is unlikely for our attachment method. A technique to increase discard survival of deepwater groupers may lead to better-constructed regulations for reef fishes in the southeastern USA and in other areas where these species are caught and released.","[Runde, Brendan J.; Buckel, Jeffrey A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, 303 Coll Circle, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA",North Carolina State University,"Runde, BJ (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, 303 Coll Circle, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",bjrunde@ncsu.edu,"Runde, Brendan/KYP-9925-2024","Buckel, Jeffrey A/0009-0002-9409-8864; Runde, Brendan/0000-0002-2125-4486",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Research Program Grant [NA14NMF4540061]; Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Research Program Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament,"This research was supported by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Cooperative Research Program Grant (NA14NMF4540061) and by The Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament.

Cox proportional hazards modelling indicated red snapper released with descender devices had significantly lower discard mortality within the first 2d (95% CI = 18.8-41.8% for descender-released vs. 44.0-72.4% for surface-released, unvented fish), while there was no significant effect of descender devices on discard mortality of gray triggerfish. Predation by large pelagic predators was estimated to account 83% of red snapper and 100% of gray triggerfish discard mortality. Discard mortality due to predation has likely been overlooked in previous mark-recapture, laboratory, and enclosure studies, suggesting cryptic population losses due to predation on discards may be underestimated for red snapper and gray triggerfish.

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.","[Scott, Molly E.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Matley, Jordan K.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada",James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; University of Windsor,"Scott, ME (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",molly.scott@my.jcu.edu.au,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Pratchett, Morgan/A-9256-2010","Simpfendorfer, Colin/0000-0002-0295-2238; Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Matley, Jordan/0000-0003-4286-597X; Scott, Molly/0000-0002-5738-221X; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation,Fisheries Research and Development Corporation,"Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grant/Award Number: FRDCDCCEE",,74,13,13,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The horizontal space use and vertical space use of two exploited reef fish, Plectropomus leopardus and P. laevis (all adults), were compared at mid-shelf Helix Reef and Lodestone Reef in the Great Barrier Reef over similar to 3 years using passive acoustic telemetry. Both species were detected throughout the 12-month duration of transmitters (mean detection period: similar to 270 days) and often made deep movements to similar to 40 m possibly related to reproductive behaviour (spawning). Differences in space use were apparent between species, with P. laevis consistently using greater area around reefs throughout the year. Overall, depth use patterns were similar between species; however, when daily detections were grouped in 2-h periods, P. laevis remained shallower and had greater variation in depth use compared to P. leopardus.

While avoidance of UV radiation has been proposed as the main driver of this behaviour, sheltering behaviour has only been studied during the day and over short timeframes. Here we applied passive acoustic telemetry techniques to continuously monitor shelter usage patterns by large reef fishes over a period of 7 months. For three sweetlip species (Haemulidae), one snapper species (Lutjanidae) and one surgeonfish species (Acanthuridae), diurnal shelter use was remarkably consistent, with occupation of shelters throughout the day, and under all weather conditions, suggesting that factors other than UV avoidance may be important in driving shelter use. Large-scale observations revealed that all fish species appeared to undertake long-distance migrations (> 1 km) away from their shelter sites each night. With the exception of the surgeonfish Acanthurus dussumieri, all fishes returned to the same areas to shelter for the entire study period. Individuals of A. dussumieri, however, failed to return on the night of a severe tropical cyclone. They never reappeared at the shelter sites. The disappearance of this species suggests that A. dussumieri probably forage at night in a different location to the carnivorous haemulids and lutjanids. Overall, this study highlights the long-term importance of shelter structures for fishes that may range over large areas of coral reefs.","[Khan, Joanna A.; Tebbett, Sterling B.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Khan, Joanna A.; Tebbett, Sterling B.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Goatley, Christopher H.

This study used acoustic telemetry to investigate movements of reef fish relative to the boundary of the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM) in Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands. Although created to enhance ecosystem protection, VICRNM boundaries were established purely on the basis of adjacency to public versus privately owned lands. Transmitters were implanted into a diversity of reef fish species representative of the local community whose movements were logged for one year on an array of acoustic-receivers that were positioned within, outside, and along the MPA boundary. Results indicate that the boundary has coincidentally aligned with a deep sandy area that does not cross through continuous reef or mangrove habitat. This acted as a natural barrier to movements of species such as Lutjanus griseus, Epinephelus guttatus, Cephalopholus cruentatus, Holocentrus rufus, and Sparisoma aurofrenatum. Other species were more mobile and were routinely detected outside VICRNM, especially at night, such as L. synagris, Haemulon plumierii, and H. sciurus. In addition to fish movements in relation to the VICRNM boundary, network analysis revealed several hotspots of concentrated fish activity including a reef promontory and bay mouths. Investment in enforcement of existing regulations to protect fish is warranted to realize the full potential of this MPA. Using these types of data, management actions in this and other MPAs can be focused on those species and locations that would experience the greatest benefit.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, CCMA,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] CSS Dynamac Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Monaco, Mark E.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

However, we document significant regional endothermy in a benthic reef fish. Individual steephead parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos (Labridae, formerly Scaridae) were tagged and their internal temperatures were monitored for a 24 h period using active acoustic telemetry. At night, on the reef, C. microrhinos were found to maintain a consistent average peritoneal cavity temperature 0.16 +/- 0.005 degrees C (SE) warmer than ambient. Diurnal internal temperatures were highly variable for individuals monitored on the reef, while in tank-based trials, peritoneal cavity temperatures tracked environmental temperatures. The mechanisms responsible for a departure of the peritoneal cavity temperature from environmental temperature occurred in C. microrhinos are not yet understood. However, the diet and behavior of the species suggests that heat in the peritoneal cavity may result primarily from endogenous thermogenesis coupled with physiological heat retention mechanisms. The presence of limited endothermy in C. microrhinos indicates that a degree of uncertainty may exist in the manner that reef fish respond to their thermal environment. At the very least, they do not always appear to respond to environmental temperatures as neutral thermal vessels and do display limited, but significant, visceral warming.","[Welsh, Justin Q.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Welsh, JQ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",justin.welsh@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011",,Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (DRB).

While it has been suggested that invasion success can be facilitated by species' ability to adapt to novel environments, direct comparisons of movement patterns between native and invaded ranges of animals in their natural habitat are rare. The rivulated rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus was introduced from the Red Sea into the Mediterranean, where it is now found in extremely high abundances, and has overgrazed the coastal marine ecosystem in many locations. Through a continuous acoustic tracking system, we found that the movement of S. rivulatus individuals at a Mediterranean site differed substantially from those at a Red Sea site, with individuals in the Mediterranean having larger overall home ranges and lower site fidelity. However, no variation between sites was found in daily home range sizes. Results show that at the Mediterranean site S. rivulatus individuals have a larger spatial footprint, which may contribute to their impact and ability to expand their distribution. This study demonstrates a potential shift in individual movement of a marine invasive species between its native and invaded range, and highlights the role of movement in understanding biological invasions.","[Pickholtz, Renanel S.

Determining reef fish habitat utilization patterns from passive acoustic arrays is challenging for the following reasons: (i) habitat classifications must be meaningful to the species, (ii) the array must contain the species' home range, and (iii) the probability of detection may differ among habitats within the array. We conducted a multi-year tracking study in the marine protected areas (MPAs) of Dry Tortugas, Florida, using a calibrated passive acoustic array deployed over habitats classified by type (reef, rubble, sand), rugosity (high, medium, low relief), and patchiness (contiguous, spur-and-groove, isolated). Our design controlled for differences between individuals, diel and edge effects, and detection gaps resulting from the nonlinear relationship between acoustic tag detection probabilities as a function of distance from the receiver. We found red and black groupers preferred high-relief reef habitats, whereas mutton and yellowtail snappers preferred low-relief contiguous reef habitats.

Behavioral impacts of sound generated from these activities on fish typically have a greater area of influence than physical injury, and may therefore adversely affect a greater portion of the local population. This study used acoustic telemetry to assess the movement, residency, and survival of 15 sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and 10 grey snapper (Lutjanus griseus) in Port Canaveral, Florida, USA, in response to 35 days of pile driving at a wharf complex. No obvious signs of mortality or injury to tagged fish were evident from the data. Received sound pressure levels from pile strikes on the interior of the wharf, where reef fish primarily occur, were on average 152 -157 dB re 1 mu Pa (peak). No significant decrease in sheepshead daytime residency was observed during pile driving within the central portion of the wharf and area of highest sound exposure, and no major indicators of displacement from the exposure wharf with the onset of pile driving were observed. There was evidence of potential displacement from the exposure wharf that coincided with the start of pile driving observed for 2 out of 4 grey snapper, along with a decrease in daytime residency for a subset of this species with high site fidelity prior to the event. Results indicate that snapper may be more likely to depart an area of pile driving disturbance more readily than sheepshead, but were less at risk for behavioral impact given the lower site fidelity of this species.","[Iafrate, Joseph D.; Watwood, Stephanie L.; Dossot, Georges A.; Crocker, Steven E.] Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA; [Reyier, Eric A.; Scheidt, Douglas M.] Kennedy Space Ctr Ecol Program, Kennedy Space Ctr, FL USA; [Reyier, Eric A.; Scheidt, Douglas M.] Integrated Miss Support Serv, Kennedy Space Ctr, FL USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Kennedy Space Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Kennedy Space Center,"Iafrate, JD (corresponding author), Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA.",joseph.iafrate@navy.mil,"Watwood, Stephanie/AAE-7191-2019","Iafrate, Joseph/0009-0000-8945-2086; Crocker, Steven/0000-0003-2698-0193; Watwood, Stephanie Lynn/0009-0006-4884-7034","United States Fleet Forces Command [N46, N4657911PO005NR]",United States Fleet Forces Command,"Funding was provided by United States Fleet Forces Command N46, Funding Document N4657911PO005NR.

The extent of movement, residence time and seasonality of the aggregation can be difficult to determine, but are important for effective management. We utilized acoustic transmitters and a receiver array to track dog snapper Lutjanus jocu and Cubera snapper Lutjanus cyanopterus within a multi-species spawning aggregation site at the Grammanik Bank in the US Virgin Islands from June 2014 to September 2015. Acoustic detections showed that both species utilized spawning areas of 1.4 to 1.5 km(2), centered at the shelf promontory. The aggregation area of L. cyanopterus was situated along the shelf edge; the L. jocu aggregation may have been displaced by L. cyanopterus as it occupied some of the inner shelf as well. Receivers along the shelf edge recorded the longest residence times during the hours of spawning (16: 45 to 20: 00 h), suggesting this is likely a spawning site for both species. L. cyanopterus aggregated monthly from May through November, with residence time peaking in August. L. jocu aggregated monthly throughout the year and residence time did not vary significantly by month. Each month, detections increased in the week before and the first week after the full moon, but then decreased to zero by the third week after the full moon.

Effective protection of spawning aggregations requires information on spawning site fidelity, residence time and timing of arrivals at, and departures from, the site. To estimate these parameters at a spawning aggregation site at Farquhar Atoll, southern Seychelles, 12 brown-marbled groupers Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and 20 camouflage groupers E. polyphekadion were tagged with acoustic transmitters, and their presence and absence was monitored by an array of acoustic receivers positioned at the site over 2 spawning seasons (2010/2011 and 2011/2012). Spawning aggregations formed during 3 consecutive spawning months each season and over-lapped spatially and temporally in the 2 species. Intra-and inter-season site fidelity was high, with 91.7% of tagged E. fuscoguttatus and 89.5% of tagged E. polyphekadion detected at the site 1 yr after tagging. The majority (2010/2011: 82.4%, 2011/2012: 80.0%) of fish detected in a spawning season visited the site during at least 2 spawning months. Residence time at the fish spawning aggregation site was influenced by sex (E. fuscoguttatus only) and spawning month (both species). Distinct periodicity in lunar timing of arrivals and departures was observed in both species.

The first experiment was conducted to understand the deployment procedures of an acoustic telemetry system and determine the appropriate deployment of receivers' spacing, while the second experiment was conducted to quantify the site fidelity and habitat use of 11 reef fish in the Fangchenggang artificial reef area in the northern South China Sea, China. The results indicated that the logistic regression model was an effective way to balance the detection probability at different distances between the range test transmitter and receiver, with above 50% detection probability within 240 m and 80% detection probability within 110 m. The residency index, as a quantification of site fidelity, was 0.85 +/- 0.24. The 100% minimum convex polygon, 95% kernel utilization distribution, and 50% kernel utilization distribution, which are the indicators of habitat use, were 34,522.94 +/- 35,548.95, 1,467.52 +/- 1,619.05, and 236.01 +/- 294.59 m(2), respectively. High site fidelity and the small spatial scale of habitat use for reef fish demonstrated that artificial reefs were an effective man-made structure to attract fish. Overall, this study supports the feasibility of the acoustic telemetry system, indicating that it provides a good approach for quantifying the associations between artificial reefs and fish.","[Lyu, Shaoliang; Lauden, Hagai Nsobi; Lin, Kun; Wang, Xuefeng] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Fisheries, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lifei] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chen, Guobao] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, South China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guobao] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Sci Observing & Expt Stn South China Sea Fishery R, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhichao] State Ocean Adm, South China Sea Stand & Metrol Ctr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Guangdong Ocean University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, CAFS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs","Wang, XF (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Fisheries, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China.",xuefeng1999@126.com,"LYU, Shaoliang/S-3773-2016; Wang, Xuefeng/G-1663-2011; Wang, Lifei/AAB-4708-2020","Wang, Lifei/0000-0003-2530-6703; LYU, Shaoliang/0000-0002-8778-1625",,,,,58,0,0,0,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

We analysed similar to 2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Friess, Claudia; Bickford, Joel W.; Addis, Dustin T.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Griffin, Lucas P.; Morley, Danielle; Casselberry, Grace A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, South Florida Reg Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Marathon, FL USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA USA; [Hammerschlag, Neil; Rider, Mitchell J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Smukall, Matthew J.; van Zinnicq Bergmann, Maurits P.

We used visual surveys and acoustic telemetry to investigate density and movement of 2 Brazilian endemic and highly targeted reef fish species inside and outside a coral reef NTZ, and subsequently inferred the effectiveness of the NTZ for protecting these species. To do so, visual surveys were performed on protected and unprotected reefs between 2016 and 2017. Moreover, 20 gray parrotfish Sparisoma axillare and 9 Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored from December 2016 to October 2017. For both species, fish densities were significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost. The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs, predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were small (0.10 to 0.45 km(2)), and both species presented spatially segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88% for S. axillare and 95% for L. alexandrei. The results showed that small NTZs that are important to part of the life cycle of a target species are an effective measure to conserve reef fish populations, and also highlight the importance of fisheries management outside NTZs.","[Lippi, Daniel Lino; Bertoldi Gaspar, Ana Lidia; Maida, Mauro; Ferreira, Beatrice Padovani] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Coxey, Mariana Sofia] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rooker, Jay R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Rooker, Jay R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Rezende, Sergio Magalhaes] Natl Ctr Res & Conservat Marine Biodivers Northea, BR-55578000 Tamandare, Brazil; [Dance, Michael A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Instituto Superior Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Lippi, DL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil.",daniel_lippi@hotmail.com,"Ferreira, Beatrice/A-5786-2013; Rooker, Jay/M-3197-2013","Gaspar, Ana Lidia Bertoldi/0000-0002-8030-9758; Lippi, Daniel/0000-0003-0272-9420; Rooker, Jay/0000-0002-5934-7688","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuc [441632/2016-5]; Petrobras S.A.-Programa Petrobras Ambiental; CNPQ [140950/2016-8, 151219/2021-4, PVE 155131/2016-8, 309216/2018-4]; GEFMAR/DIBIO/ICMBio; [PVE 401594/2014-9]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuc(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Petrobras S.A.-Programa Petrobras Ambiental(Petrobras); CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); GEFMAR/DIBIO/ICMBio;","This work was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuco (441632/2016-5), and the visiting scholar program (PVE 401594/2014-9).

It is essential to understand the degrees to which platforms support fish over time to indicate whether biological requirements (e.g., shelter, diet, reproduction) are being met. To determine the ecological importance of platforms as fish habitat, the site fidelity and depth/habitat use of adult cabezon, Scorpaenichthys marmoratus (Ayres, 1854), grass rockfish, Sebastes rastrelliger (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880), kelp rockfish, Sebastes atrovirens (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880), and California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher (Ayres, 1854) were investigated at platforms Edith (50 m bottom depth) and Eureka (212 m). A total of 63 fish were acoustically tagged and monitored for up to 578 d. Sixty-three percent of individuals were still present at platforms at the end of the study (long-term site fidelity), with 55 individuals detected a mean of 66.9% (SD 36.0%) of their total days at liberty (daily site fidelity). All species displayed a shift in seasonal depth use. The shallowest horizontal level, consisting of various horizontal beams at platform Edith (15 m depth) and Eureka (17 m), was the most utilized habitat by grass rockfish, kelp rockfish, and California sheephead. Cabezon at platform Eureka utilized depths (21-31 m) unassociated with horizontal levels, while at platform Edith they primarily utilized the second horizontal level (30 m). Decommissioning options that remove the shallowest 26 m of structure would eliminate the habitat most utilized by three of the four study species that dominate the nearshore reef fish communities at SPS platforms.","[Mireles, Carlos; Martin, Christopher J.

While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.","[Marshell, A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Marshell, A.; Mills, J.

While the spatial scales over which these processes occur have been evaluated, the spatial ecology of individual taxa responsible for shaping these processes is almost entirely unknown. This study combined acoustic telemetry and ecological assessments to evaluate the movement patterns and feeding range of a functionally important coral reef fish, Chlorurus microrhinos (f. Labridae). The diurnal home range and feeding areas of C. microrhinos, on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, were quantified using active acoustic telemetry. The average diurnal home range of C. microrhinos was 7,830 m(2) +/- 940 (SE). Core areas of activity (50% kernel utilization distributions) were relatively small, encompassing approximately 22% of an individual's home range (1,690 m(2) +/- 220). Core areas exhibited greater topographic complexity. C. microrhinos may select these areas because of decreased predation risk. Feeding intensities were not homogenous throughout the home range. Core areas were found to have a greater number of feeding scars and are thus exposed to increased bioerosion and algal removal by C. microrhinos. While important in shaping key ecosystem processes, the ecosystem impact of individual C. microrhinos in Pioneer Bay appears to be restricted to small areas within a narrow band along the reef crest.","[Welsh, J.

In this study, we selected 3 species, Sparisoma viride (Scaridae), Acanthurus chirurgus (Acanthuridae), and Lutjanus apodus (Lutjanidae), to quantify their home ranges, evaluate their site fidelity, and identify movement patterns in Martinique (14 degrees 36' N, 61 degrees 32' W). Two complementary tagging methods (external Floy tags and acoustic telemetry) were utilised to monitor movement patterns on different spatial scales from November 2009 to November 2011. We tagged 673 A. chirurgus, 131 L. apodus, and 217 S. viride with Floy tags and 30 A. chirurgus, 47 L. apodus, and 37 S. viride with acoustic tags. The results revealed that several individuals maintained a small preferential site for several months to over a year. Other individuals were able to move long distances (< 9 km) outside the MPA over a short period (< 3 d) and never returned to the MPA. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tagging methods and long-term observations to improve the monitoring of fish movement relative to MPA design and effectiveness. Despite the fragmented habitat in the studied MPA, the results highlight that small MPAs (9.56 km(2)) could protect the 3 studied species. This study also demonstrated that natural barriers (large areas of silt and sand) were crossed by some individuals. Our findings provide relevant information on these species that should be utilised to better inform MPA design and decision-making processes, management, and overall MPA effectiveness.","[Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Rousseau, Yann] CNRS Guyane, USR3456, Cayenne 97300, French Guiana; [Legrand, Helene] DEAL, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU),"Garcia, J (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol Hidrol, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",jessicagarcia.mpa@gmail.com,"Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009",,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,"Financial support for this study was provided by Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.

Bluespine unicornfish were site-attached to home ranges situated within the reserve boundaries and their movements were aligned with topographic features. Two different diel movement patterns ('commuting' and 'foraying') were observed. Commuters made crepuscular migrations of several hundred meters between daytime foraging areas and nighttime refuge holes. Foraying fish did not partake in crepuscular migrations and utilized refuge holes both day and night. Two bluespine unicornfish were also nocturnally active. There was little direct evidence of dispersal from the reserve but differences in bluespine unicornfish abundance and size among reef habitat zones were consistent with ontogenetic habitat shifts. The influence of habitat topography on bluespine unicornfish movements suggests that gross habitat characteristics could be used to predict reef fish movements. This could provide a simple method for setting marine reserve boundaries at sites for which empirical fish movement data are unavailable.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021",,,,,,37,100,114,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

One of the most important tourism sectors in aquatic environments is scuba diving, an activity considered sustainable given its non-extractive nature and capability of bringing relevant socio-economic benefits to local communities. However, knowledge about its impact on the activity patterns of aquatic animals is still scarce. Here, we used biotelemetry techniques to assess the importance of scuba diving in modulating the activity patterns of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus, Lowe, 1834), a marine predatory fish of high interest for fishing and tourism. We implemented Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on high-resolution acceleration data using a temporal and spatial control while controlling for a set of environmental variables (i.e. photoperiod, time-of-day, moon phase, temperature, wave height, and intensity and direction of marine currents) within a multiple-use marine protected area, and diving tourism hot-spot, of the western Mediterranean Sea. Our results underlined the more decisive influence of environmental-related stressors on the activity patterns of the dusky grouper compared to the impact of scuba diving. A high heterogeneity existed in the response against most of the stressors, including the presence of scuba divers. Overall, the activity of dusky grouper was higher at night than at day, showing a positive relationship with wave height, water temperature, and current intensity and a negative one with the moon phase. Remarkably, our findings, based on novel biotelemetry tools, differed substantially from the common wisdom accepted for this species. In conclusion, there is no clear evidence of scuba divers influence on the general activity patterns of the dusky grouper. Beyond their relevance from an ecological perspective, these results provide useful insights for the sustainable management of coastal resources, suggesting that scuba diving, when properly carried out, can represent an important sector to foster for the blue growth of coastal communities.","[Pereniguez, J.

The Nassau Grouper Epinephelus striatus is a Caribbean coral reef fish that displays such spawning aggregations, which have been overfished to the point of threatening the species. Using acoustic telemetry, we examined the size at which Nassau Grouper migrate to spawning aggregations, the timing of migrations, and the distance of migration routes used by Nassau Grouper from within and outside of a large, no-take marine reserve in the central Bahamas. Fish (total n = 19) were tagged in 2004 (n = 6) and 2005 (n = 13) and were tracked for one to four spawning seasons. Fish that were 54 cm TL or greater made spawning migrations, with all but one migrating southward along the shelf edge of Exuma Sound for a distance of 70 km to over 200 km, usually during the December full moon. Fish typically made one migration annually, which lasted from 1 to 3 weeks, with fish remaining at spawning sites for only 1-2 d; however, when the full moon was early in the spawning season, several fish remained away from their home reefs through two lunar cycles or delayed their migrations by a month, and one fish made two migrations. Fish that were migrating for the first time had slower swimming speeds to spawning sites than did experienced fish, but swimming speeds were similar between the two groups during return migrations, suggesting that their migration behavior was learned. Our results demonstrate that spawning migration patterns for this species may be more variable in The Bahamas than at other Caribbean locations. The present findings also have important implications for the management of the species, including increasing the minimum size limit to 54 cm or larger and the use of both marine protected areas and seasonal closures to rebuild the spawning stock.","[Dahlgren, C.

Because most of the past telemetric studies on this ecologically and commercially important species were short in duration and did not cover the reproductive season, we set out to use longer-term passive acoustic telemetry to test this hypothesis. We found that white seabream expands its home range and increases the frequency of forays during the reproductive season, but found no obvious signs of spawning aggregations. Our results thus provide evidence for short-range behavioral shifts in fish space use related to reproductive activity, and support the notion that small MPAs may be effective in managing reef fish populations by effectively protecting their spawning biomass.

Those species responsible for maintaining functional connectivity between habitats are often called mobile links and are regarded as essential elements of resilience. By providing connectivity, they support resilience across spatial scales. Most marine organisms, including fishes, have long-term, biogeographic-scale connectivity through larval movement. Although most reef species are highly site attached after larval settlement, some taxa may also be able to provide rapid, reef-scale connectivity as adults. On coral reefs, the identity of such taxa and the extent of their mobility are not yet known. We use acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of Kyphosus vaigiensis, one of the few reef fishes that feeds on adult brown macroalgae. Unlike other benthic herbivorous fish species, it also exhibits large-scale (> 2 km) movements. Individual K. vaigiensis cover, on average, a 2.5 km length of reef (11 km maximum) each day. These large-scale movements suggest that this species may act as a mobile link, providing functional connectivity, should the need arise, and helping to support functional processes across habitats and spatial scales. An analysis of published studies of home ranges in reef fishes found a consistent relationship between home range size and body length. K. vaigiensis is the sole herbivore to depart significantly from the expected home range-body size relationship, with home range sizes more comparable to exceptionally mobile large pelagic predators rather than other reef herbivores. While the large-scale movements of K. vaigiensis reveal its potential capacity to enhance resilience over large areas, it also emphasizes the potential limitations of small marine reserves to protect some herbivore populations.","[Welsh, J.

It would be advantageous to these organisms if they were also able to use sound to remotely identify suitable settlement habitats. However, it is unknown whether different coastal habitats produce different sounds that would be capable of providing distinctive cues for larvae. This study identified marked differences in the characteristics of ambient underwater sound at 3 distinct types of coastal habitat: a macroalgal-dominated reef, a sea urchin-dominated reef, and a sandy beach, The sea urchin-dominated reef habitat produced sound that was significantly more intense overall in a biologically important frequency band (800 to 2500 Hz), compared with that from macroalgal-dominated reefs and beach habitats. The sound produced by snapping shrimp also exhibited marked differences among habitat types, with the sea urchin-dominated reef having significantly more snaps than the macroalgal-dominated reef or beach habitat. Many of the differences in the sound produced by the 2 reef habitats became more apparent at dusk compared with noon. This study provides evidence that there are significant differences in the spectral and temporal composition of ambient sound associated with different coastal habitat types over relatively short spatial scales. An acoustic cue that conveys both directional and habitat quality information that is transmitted considerable distances offshore would have the potential to be of immense value to the pelagic larval stage of a coastal organism attempting to remotely locate a suitable habitat in which to settle.","[Radford, C.

In this study, passive telemetry and fine-scale habitat data were integrated for the first time to investigate the relevance of community fishery reserves (CFRs) for managing reef fish resources. In Efate Island (Vanuatu), 38 thumbprint emperors Lethrinus harak (Lethrinidae) were tagged at 7 sites and tracked between April 2011 and February 2012 using an acoustic array of 16 receivers. The survey area extended over 11.3 km(2) of fringing reef in 3 coastal community tenures that included 3 small CFRs. Habitats were mapped using very high resolution satellite imagery and ground-truthing. Thirty fish were detected for up to 229 d (median = 153 d). Six geographical groups were identified among 21 resident fish. These groups showed strong fidelity to small sites (116 to 763 m) that were located in reserves and fished areas, across community tenures, and across 12 habitat types. Overall, 42 excursions were detected at several hundreds to thousands of meters from the fidelity sites along contiguous fringing reefs, across habitat types, and across boundaries of CFRs and community tenures. The estimated home range size of L. harak ranged from 116 to 3979 m (median: 763 m) and was highly varied within fish groups. We concluded that home range size and behavioral plasticity of L. harak limit the effectiveness of small individual CFRs for protecting this species. Networks of CFRs would be more effective but require management arrangements between neighbor communities.","[Leopold, Marc; Gabriault, H.; Andrefouet, S.; Dumas, P.] Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Leopold, Marc; Ham, J.; Raubani, J.; Dumas, P.] Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Chateau, O.; Gabriault, H.] Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea 98807, New Caledonia",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Léopold, M (corresponding author), Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.;Léopold, M (corresponding author), Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu.",marc.leopold@ird.fr,,"Dumas, Pascal/0000-0001-7369-8989",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),"This study was funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Pacific Fund, the Government of New Caledonia, and the Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department).

Groupers are especially susceptible to overexploitation, because they aggregate to reproduce at specific locations and times. An understanding of the spatial dynamics of these fishes is critical for fisheries management and conservation. However, movements and migration dynamics of endangered reef fishes are poorly known. We show, using acoustic telemetry, that Nassau groupers Epinephelus striatus exhibit highly synchronised migration to spawning sites, despite their otherwise solitary habits. Reproductive adults leave their individual territories in shallow waters near the winter full moons, and migrate to the same spawning site up to 4 times yr(-1). At the spawning site, a remarkable population-wide depth change occurs within an hour as individuals dive to a maximum depth of 255 m. Our results greatly expand the previously known migration frequency and depth range of this species, and reveal an unexpected yet predictable complexity of adult fish migration between habitats. Effective conservation of this threatened species requires that deeper reefs and the timing of migration events be incorporated into fisheries management plans.","Univ Calif, Sea Grant Extens Program, Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 90293 USA; CSIC, Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, Blanes, Spain; Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); University of Barcelona,"Starr, RM (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Sea Grant Extens Program, Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",starr@mlml.calstate.edu,"Ballesteros, Enric/K-6497-2012",,,,,,43,96,117,0,35,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

An alternative is to protect essential habitats, such as spawning grounds, especially if these are stable over time. We studied the movements and habitat use patterns of white trevally Pseudocaranx dentex (Carangidae), a commercially important species, to assist in the design of marine reserves. Diel, seasonal and inter-annual movements of trevally were studied using active acoustic tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-release in the Faial Channel, Azores Islands. White trevally were captured at inshore and offshore reefs. Inshore trevally moved daily alongshore, using large activity spaces, while the short-term movements of offshore trevally were restricted to the reef summits. During the summer spawning season, both groups displayed frequent migrations of up to several kilometres, but inshore fish remained inshore, whereas offshore reef fish expanded their range to include visits to inshore sites. This behaviour eventually resulted in low long-term residence within the study area, especially that of inshore fish. During the spawning season, one inshore site was visited by most of the fish. However, instead of gathering in large aggregations at a single location, it appears that the trevally adopted a multiple-site visiting behaviour, which may increase mating opportunities through mixing between inshore and offshore fish that are otherwise segregated for most of the year. Protection of spawning biomass and sites for this species seems potentially feasible, but this would require protecting a suite of sites per island. Furthermore, because fish would not be fully protected under this scenario, we argue that such spatial management measures need to be accompanied by conventional fishing-effort control measures applied to all local populations.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589","FCT/MCTES [SFRH/BD/11132/2002, SFRH/ BD/12788/2003]; Associated Laboratory ISR; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/12788/2003, SFRH/BD/11132/2002] Funding Source: FCT",FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Associated Laboratory ISR; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We sincerely thank A.

Often found in schools, Scarus rivulatus, is an abundant herbivorous species on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, especially on inshore reefs. Recent evidence has highlighted the limited spatial movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools). Each individual may therefore have little impact on the spatial resilience of coral reefs.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Currey, LM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Leanne.Currey@my.jcu.edu.au,"Currey-Randall, Leanne/AAS-8975-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Williams, Ashley/ABA-5921-2020; Williams, Ashley/G-2017-2014","Williams, Ashley/0000-0002-5530-0073; Currey-Randall, Leanne M/0000-0002-3772-1288; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Australian Research Council; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,"We thank the staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group for assisting with this project, particularly A.

The movement behavior of coral reef fish is a complex mechanism that is highly linked to species life-history traits, predation risk and food resources. We used passive acoustic telemetry to study monthly, daily and hourly movement patterns and space use in two species, Schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus) and Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride). We investigated the spatial overlap between the two species and compared intra-specific spatial overlap between day and night. Presence-absence models showed different diel presence and habitat use patterns between the two species. We constructed a spatial network of the movement patterns, which showed that for both species when fish were detected by the array of receivers most movements were made around the coral reef habitat while occasionally moving to silt habitats. Our results show that most individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations and habitat types, although individual behavioral changes were observed for some individuals across time. Our study also highlights the necessity to consider multiple species during MPA implementation and to take into account the specific biological and ecological traits of each species. The low number of fish detected within the receiver array, as well as the intraspecific variability observed in this study, highlight the need to compare results across species and individuals to be used for MPA management.

The western blue groper (Achoerodus gouldii) is the largest permanent-resident reef teleost in southern Australian waters and has the second-oldest recorded age of any labrid at 70 years. Acoustic telemetry was used to investigate whether adult A. gouldii can be effectively protected within adequately sized no-take MPAs. Ten passive acoustic receivers tracked the movements of 15 A. gouldii individuals (69-112-cm total length; 7-31-kg weight) at a site off north-western Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Most of the fish displayed high site fidelity (91-100% residence time for 10 of the 11 fish with useful data) for a narrow strip of fringing coastal reef (similar to 1-km length by similar to 40-m width) throughout a 12-month period. Mean home-range along-shore length and area were estimated at 1076 +/- 83m (s.e.), and 45 188 +/- 3497 m(2), respectively (n = 11 fish with useful data). Comparison with other resident temperate-reef teleosts indicated no relationship between fish length and home-range area, and that A. gouldii has a relatively small home range. The high site fidelity and small home range of adult A. gouldii individuals makes localised populations amenable to a high level of protection within no-take MPAs.","[Bryars, Simon; McDonald, Bryan] Dept Environm & Nat Resources, Keswick, SA 5035, Australia; [Rogers, Paul; Huveneers, Charlie] S Australian Res & Dev Inst, W Beach, SA 5024, Australia; [Rogers, Paul; Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Bedford Pk, SA 5042, Australia; [Payne, Nicholas] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Smith, Ian] Zoos S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Bryars, S (corresponding author), POB 67, Verdun, SA 5245, Australia.",sbryars@bigpond.com,"Payne, Nicholas/E-7811-2013","Smith, Ian G/0000-0003-3813-2917; Huveneers, Charlie/0000-0001-8937-1358; Payne, Nicholas/0000-0002-5274-471X","Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR); Wildlife Conservation Fund; South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) Aquatic Sciences; Flinders University of South Australia, Zoos SA; University of Adelaide; Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS); Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)/National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)","Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR); Wildlife Conservation Fund; South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) Aquatic Sciences; Flinders University of South Australia, Zoos SA; University of Adelaide; Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS); Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)/National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)","This study was supported by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Wildlife Conservation Fund, the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) Aquatic Sciences, the Flinders University of South Australia, Zoos SA, the University of Adelaide, and the Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS) and the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS)/National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).

In this work, we combined the analysis of multi-year landings and underwater visual census with acoustic telemetry to investigate the long-term movement patterns (up to 4 years) of almaco jack, Seriola rivoliana, a large reef top predator, in one protected and one unprotected offshore shallow seamount in the Azores, central North Atlantic. Although the analysis of visual census and landing data suggests a pronounced seasonal pattern of occurrence, we found that tagged fish were almost continuously detected at the seamounts for up to four consecutive years. Some individuals showed a few long periods of undetection of 1-2 months in the Formigas reserve, mostly in the fall and winter. Mobility within this seamount increased during spring and summer, and geostrophic current speed was negatively correlated with detection probability. Overall, the acoustic telemetry results showed that adult almaco jacks were resident year-round, refuting the traditional view that these fish are essentially migratory and a seasonal occurrence in the Azores. Given the intrinsic vulnerability of resident fish to fishing, our results highlight the importance of protecting these sites in order to preserve these mature fish aggregations with high reproductive potential.","[Fontes, Jorge; Schmiing, Mara; Afonso, Pedro] Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores,"Fontes, J (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Rua Prof Doutor Frederico Machado, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",fontes@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Schmiing, Mara/0000-0001-7556-217X; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589","FCT/MEC; Azorean DRCTC (OE, FEDER/COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia); project MARMACII [INTEREG/05/MAC/4.2/A4]; project SEAMOV [PTDC/MAR/108232/2008]; project MoniZEC [DRCT/0281M2.1.2/I/018/2011]; FCT/MCTES program; DRCT Reequipamento program","FCT/MEC; Azorean DRCTC (OE, FEDER/COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia); project MARMACII; project SEAMOV; project MoniZEC; FCT/MCTES program; DRCT Reequipamento program","We thank T.

Although this study focuses on movements and habitat use of a single fish species in the Tortugas, the results are relevant to the design of marine reserve networks intended to protect and manage fishes that undergo transient spawning migrations in other locations as well.","[Feeley, Michael W.; Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro; Barbera, Paul; Hunt, John] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA; [Switzer, Ted] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Burton, Michael] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Feeley, Michael W.] Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Network, 18001 Old Cutler Rd,Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA",Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Feeley, MW (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA.;Feeley, MW (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Network, 18001 Old Cutler Rd,Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA.",michael_feeley@nps.gov; danielle.morley@myfwc.com; alejandro.acosta@myfwc.com; paul.barbera@myfwc.com; john.hunt@myfwc.com; ted.switzer@myfwc.com; michael.burton@noaa.gov,"Burton, Michael/ABE-4500-2020","Morley, Danielle/0000-0001-7286-0606","USGS State Partnership Program [007-0083-023, 08ERAG0007]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program [MOA-2001-683, 004/7477 (1007-2009), (006)/7910, MOA-2010-026/8081]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (NOS) [MOA-2010-026/8081]; Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida [DFO 0809-03]; National Park Service [DRTO-2008-SCI-0003, DRTO-2010-SCI-0006]; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary [FKNMS-2008-015, FKNMS-2013-040]",USGS State Partnership Program; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (NOS); Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida; National Park Service; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary,"This research was supported by the USGS State Partnership Program (Project Number: 007-0083-023 and Grant # 08ERAG0007), NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (MOA-2001-683 Amendment No. 004/7477 (1007-2009), (Amendment No.006)/7910; NOS Agreement No. MOA-2010-026/8081), and Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant (DFO 0809-03) through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida and conducted under scientific research permits issued by the National Park Service (DRTO-2008-SCI-0003, DRTO-2010-SCI-0006) and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS-2008-015, FKNMS-2013-040).

Nine lobsters collected in the Capo Gallo - Isola delle Femmine marine protected area (northwestern Sicily, central Mediterranean) were tagged with miniaturized transmitters and released at a single site inside the protected area. The lobsters were monitored with the purpose of calculating their horizontal and vertical positions, analysing their movement patterns to assess their homing capability, and calculating their daily home range. Five lobsters moved back close to the capture sites within the first 20 hours after release ('homed'). The remaining four lobsters 'relocated' to a different refuge. Homed lobsters had a larger home range than relocated lobsters. This study provides the first description of a homing pattern with high spatial resolution in the wild European spiny lobster as inferred by ultrasonic telemetry.","[Giacalone, Vincenzo M.; Buffa, Gaspare] CNR, Ist Studio Impatti Antrop & Sostenibilita Ambient, Via Mare 3, I-91021 Campobello Di Mazara, Italy; [Zenone, Arturo; Badalamenti, Fabio; Gristina, Michele; Pipitone, Carlo; D'Anna, Giovanni] CNR, Ist Studio Impatti Antrop & Sostenibilita Ambient, Via Giovanni da Verrazzano 17, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, Italy; [Ciancio, Javier] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, CCT CENPAT, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos CESIMAR, Blvd Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per lo Studio degli Impatti Antropici Sostenibilita in Ambiente Marino (IAS-CNR); Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto per lo Studio degli Impatti Antropici Sostenibilita in Ambiente Marino (IAS-CNR); Centro Nacional Patagonico (CENPAT); Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Pipitone, C (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Studio Impatti Antrop & Sostenibilita Ambient, Via Giovanni da Verrazzano 17, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, Italy.",carlo.pipitone@cnr.it,"GIACALONE, VINCENZOMAXIMILIANO/N-8590-2015; Zenone, Arturo/JJF-7484-2023; buffa, gaspare/HKW-3831-2023; Pipitone, Carlo/B-7562-2015; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/B-8508-2015; D'ANNA, GIOVANNI/B-7995-2015","Pipitone, Carlo/0000-0002-7632-1228; BADALAMENTI, FABIO/0000-0002-2395-454X; Zenone, Arturo/0000-0001-5540-7148; D'ANNA, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-8644-8222; Ciancio, Javier/0000-0003-1674-842X; BUFFA, GASPARE/0000-0003-4110-2161",Capo Gallo-Isola delle Femmine MPA; RECOMPRA project under the FP7-PEOPLE program [295213],Capo Gallo-Isola delle Femmine MPA; RECOMPRA project under the FP7-PEOPLE program,"The authors would like to thank Prof. Ricardo Rosa, Viviana Marquez Velasquez, Carlo Patti and the ASD Alalonga diving center for their help during fieldwork, Giuseppe Di Stefano for technical support during the study and Krill cooperative for arranging the storage tank and maintaining the lobsters healthy between catch and release.

We placed sonic transmitters in, and tracked movements of, white sea bream (Diplodus sargus sargus) in the no-take zone of a Mediterranean marine protected area: the Torre Guaceto marine protected area, (Adriatic Sea, Italy). Tagged fish displayed three types of diel activity patterns in three different habitats: sand, rocky reefs and matte of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Individuals were more active during the day than at night. Overall, white sea bream displayed a remarkable behavioural plasticity in habitat use. Our results indicate that the observed behavioural plasticity in the marine protected area could be the result of multiple ecological and environmental drivers such as size, sex and increased intra-specific competition. Our findings support the view that habitat diversity helps support high densities of fishes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The acoustic environment is one source of potentially useful information about these behaviors. We implanted an acoustic recording tag (Bioacoustic Probe) into the gut cavity of a blacktip reef shark to determine whether an implanted tag could successfully record external and internal sounds. The tag successfully recorded reef fish vocalizations, boat engine noise, the sound of the shark feeding and unidentified rhythmic sounds that may derive from shark tail beats. Technical challenges remain, but sound recording tags have the potential to provide novel insights into shark and fish ecology.","[Meyer, Carl G.; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Burgess, William C.] Greeneridge Sci Inc, Felton, CA 95018 USA; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, PO Box 1346,Cocnut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,29,11,14,3,26,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0990-7440,1765-2952,,AQUAT LIVING RESOUR,Aquat.

Between August 2010 and September 2012, we used acoustic telemetry to continuously monitor movements of 31 Lutjanus argentiventris (yellow snapper) and 25 Mycteroperca rosacea (leopard grouper) at Los Islotes, a small no-take reserve and reported spawning site for both species in the SW Gulf of California. Though the majority of fish from both species exhibited moderate levels of site fidelity to Los Islotes (snapper: present 49 +/- 30% of days since tagging, grouper: 64 +/- 30%), cluster analyses revealed multiple patterns of site fidelity within species. Approximately 30% of snapper exhibited decreases in site fidelity during the spawning season, and snapper did not spawn at the reserve during the study. Grouper spawning aggregations at Los Islotes were visually observed in 2011 and 2012, though the abundance of fish and the intensity of courtship behaviors were reduced in comparison with reported aggregations elsewhere in the Gulf. Three snapper and 2 grouper made repeated movements across pelagic waters between Los Islotes and Marisla Seamount, another documented aggregation site in the SW Gulf. The demonstrated variation in movements of these species over multiple temporal and spatial scales warrants consideration of movement patterns in assessments of reserve performance, as well as the combination of traditional fisheries regulations (e.g. size limits) with marine reserves throughout the Gulf.","[TinHan, Thomas; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA; [Erisman, Brad; Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weaver, Amy; Vazquez-Arce, Daniel] Sociedad Hist Nat Niparaja AC, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"TinHan, T (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA.",t.tinhan@gmail.com,"Erisman, Brad/P-1640-2019","Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio/0000-0002-8173-1432; TinHan, Thomas/0000-0002-5610-7718",Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture [DGOPA-05356-140710-3457],Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture,"We thank 3 anonymous reviewers for their help in improving the manuscript.

In the Seychelles, FSAs of this species occur monthly between September and June around the full moon. To study the spawning aggregation dynamics of S. sutor, 39 reproductively active individuals were acoustically tagged and monitored at 3 known FSA sites (Pate Polite, Pate Desire and Pate Dividi) off the west coast of Praslin island (Seychelles) between October 2010 and April 2011. The presence and absence of tagged fish at the 3 sites were monitored using moored arrays of passive acoustic receivers, while the density of fish at the FSAs was quantified using underwater visual census (UVC). Most tagged fish (87.0%) detected in more than 1 spawning period showed fidelity to single spawning sites. Predominantly, tagged individuals arrived at FSA sites at dawn and departed at dusk. Spawning residency times at FSA sites ranged from 0.02 to 16.1 d. At Pate Polite, residency times were higher in the first half of the spawning season. Residency times were often several-fold shorter than aggregation duration which, when combined with patterns in arrival and departure times, indicates high turnover of fish within aggregations. The findings of this study provide information needed for emerging co-management schemes that aim to sustain this socio-economically important fishery.","[Bijoux, Jude P.; Dagorn, Laurent] IRD, UMR 212, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Berke, Gregory; Robinson, Jan] Seychelles Fishing Author, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Cowley, Paul D.] S African Inst Aquat Biodivers, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Soria, Marc] IRD, UMR 212, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Gaertner, Jean-Claude] IFREMER, UPF IRD ILM, UMR 241 EIO, Faaa, Tahiti, France; [Robinson, Jan] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer; James Cook University,"Bijoux, JP (corresponding author), IRD, UMR 212, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.",jude.bijoux@ird.fr,"Dagorn, Laurent/K-1002-2016; Cowley, Paul/M-4264-2017","Cowley, Paul/0000-0003-1246-4390",Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) [MASMA/OR/2008/06]; Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP) [SEY/SGP/OP4/Y3/RAF/2010/05]; Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) through the European Union (EU) of the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Protocols under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (IRD-DSF),Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA); Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP); Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) through the European Union (EU) of the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Protocols under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (IRD-DSF),This work was supported through grants from the Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program (Grant No. MASMA/OR/2008/06) of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) and from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP) to the Praslin Fishers Association (PFA) (Grant No. SEY/SGP/OP4/Y3/RAF/2010/05).

The direct benefit of this protection, the so called 'reserve effect', is the build-up of biomass through an increase in individual numbers and size. This effect can take several years depending on the life history traits of the target species. However, empirical studies on individual fish spatial behaviour at temporal scales long enough to be compatible with that of invoking the reserve effect are still virtually lacking. We studied the inter-annual patterns of habitat use of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), an endangered reef fish predator, using passive acoustic telemetry inside and around a small marine reserve in the Azores, mid-north Atlantic. All 11 individuals resided in the reserve year-round for up to 5 years. During these periods, fish were detected nearly every day and utilised stable core activity areas. Two smaller fish apparently abandoned the area after some time, probably relocating outside the reserve. Our results indicate that even small marine reserves can promote the long-term recovery of some endangered species if the long-term behaviour (i.e. site fidelity) of individuals is appropriate. This result bears direct implications for most existing coastal marine reserves, given that they fall into the small size range and many overexploited reef fish species may be highly site attached.

The guns were fired once/min for eight periods on four days at different positions. The structure and intensity of the sound of each triple G. gun explosion was recorded and calibrated, Peak sound pressure levels of 210 dB (rel to 1 mu Pa) at 16 m range and 195 dB (rel to 1 mu Pa) at 109m range were measured at positions where the fish were being observed. The final position of the triple G. gun, at 5.3 m range, had a peak pressure level of 218 dB (rel to 1 mu Pa). Neither the fish, nor the invertebrates, showed any signs of moving away from the reef. Firing the guns did not interrupt a diurnal rhythm of fish gathering at dusk and passing the TV camera position while the guns were firing. The longterm day-to-night movements of two tagged pollack were slightly changed by the arrival and banging of the guns particularly when positioned within 10 m of their normal living positions. Those reef fish, watched by the TV camera, always showed involuntary reactions in the form of a Mauthner cell reflex, C-start, at each explosion of the guns at all ranges tested (maximum range was 109 m, 195 dB rel to 1 mu Pa). When the explosion source was not visible to the fish, the C-start reaction was cut short and the fish continued with what they were doing before the stimulus. When the G. gun rack was sunk to the seabed (depth 14m) visible to the fish and the TV camera, those fish that were observed approaching the G. gun rack when the guns were fired were seen to turn and flee from the very visible explosion. When the gun rack was suspended midwater (5 In depth) and just outside visible range at 16 metres, the fish receiving a 6 ms peak to peak, 206dB (rel to 1 mu Pa) pressure swing exhibited a C-start and then continued to swim towards the gun position, their intended swimming track apparently unaltered. The sound of the G. guns had little effect on the day-to-day behaviour of the resident fish and invertebrates. Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Concern over fishing of Chrysophrys auratus spawning aggregations in embayments near a west Australian city led to an annual 4-month spatial fishing closure. However, the extent to which it protects fish migrating to and from aggregations is unclear. Acoustic telemetry demonstrated a bimodal pattern of entry to and departure from the main embayment via only one of several pathways. Among years, 33%-56% of fish occurred in the pathway prior to the closure, but most left before it ceased. Fish were detected within the closure in multiple but not always consecutive years. Variation in migration timing and aggregation philopatry may alter capture risk, but pre- and postspawning migratory fish are fished in the main pathway and adjacent reefs, which would presumably impact spawning aggregation biomass. Assessment of this would assist in understanding whether expansion of the closure's spatial and temporal limits is necessary to ensure spawning biomass or whether current management is sufficient.","[Crisafulli, B.

In studies of an organism's functional ecology, key behavioural traits such as foraging periodicity are assumed to be uniform across the species. In particular, the fundamental division between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns is usually assumed to be a fixed one, with organisms demonstrating physiological traits optimised for a particular diel rhythm. 2. In this study, we explore the activity rhythm of a tropical reef fish, the golden-lined rabbitfish, Siganus lineatus. We make use of acoustic telemetry (manual tracking), combined with underwater observations of feeding behaviour to investigate the diel foraging patterns of S. lineatus, at three sites around the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. 3. We found significant differences in the activity patterns of shoreline and reef-based populations of S. lineatus. Individuals inhabiting the boulder-shoreline site foraged during the day and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the two reef populations foraged only during nocturnal hours, remaining stationary at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish. 4. We suggest that S. lineatus is a diurnal nominal herbivore whose biological rhythm has developed the flexibility to be nocturnal. This development may simply represent the masking effects of predation, competition or ontogeny, or it may represent entrainment over an evolutionary time-scale necessary to enable the species to expand its range into the coral reef environment. 5. Either way, the results identify S. lineatus as a potential subject for research into the relative importance of the various biological forces driving divisions along the temporal niche axis and suggest that the species has the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at the ecological and evolutionary level.","[Fox, Rebecca J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Fox, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.fox@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011",,"Australian Research Council; Lizard Island Reef Research Foundation (LIDF); Australian Coral Reef Society; Vemco, a division of Amirix Pty Ltd","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Lizard Island Reef Research Foundation (LIDF); Australian Coral Reef Society; Vemco, a division of Amirix Pty Ltd","We thank A.

Establishing whether pairing is based on mating, or an alternative cooperative advantage, can be difficult, especially where species show no obvious sexual dimorphism and where the act of reproduction itself is difficult to observe. In the tropical marine fishes known as rabbitfish (Siganidae), half of extant species live in socially monogamous, territorial pairs. It has been assumed that partnerships are for mating, but the reproductive mode of pairing rabbitfish is currently unconfirmed. Using passive acoustic telemetry to track movements of fishes belonging to one such species (Siganus doliatus), we provide the first evidence that paired adult fish undertake highly synchronized migrations with multiple conspecifics on a monthly cycle. All tagged individuals migrated along the same route in three consecutive months and were absent from home territories for 2-3 days just after the new moon. The timing and directionality of migrations suggest that S. doliatus may form spawning aggregations, offering the potential for exposure to multiple reproductive partners. The finding raises fundamental questions about the basis of pairing, mate choice and partnership longevity in this family.","[Fox, Rebecca J.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Fox, Rebecca J.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Fox, Rebecca J.; Bellwood, David R.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Fox, Rebecca J.; Jennions, Michael D.] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Evolut Ecol & Genet, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; James Cook University; James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian National University,"Fox, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia.",rebecca.fox-1@uts.edu.au,"Jennions, Michael/C-7560-2009; Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011","Jennions, MIchael D/0000-0001-9221-2788",Australian Research Council; Australia Integrated Marine Observing System (AATAMS Division Receiver Loan Pool Award),Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australia Integrated Marine Observing System (AATAMS Division Receiver Loan Pool Award),This study was funded by the Australian Research Council (D.R.B. and M.D.J.) and by Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (AATAMS Division Receiver Loan Pool Award to R.J.F.).,,23,9,9,0,17,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

The monitored fish was caught in the study site and surgically implanted with an ultrasonic transmitter. The fish displayed a regular diurnal rhythm during 25 days before leaving the area. Different patterns of spatial use were identified. The temporal succession of these patterns indicates that the minimum distance covered by the fish every day ranged between 20 and 200 m. Its home range was at least 5 ha. A decrease of the detection was observed before the departure of the fish. This decrease coincided with the beginning of the reproduction period in New Caledonia and supports the hypothesis of a fish departure for the reproductive event.

Although there has been extensive study of the habitat requirements of adults, particularly during spawning, relatively little is known about the habitat requirements of juveniles. Many juvenile fish use structural components of habitat to alleviate the risk of predation as well as for foraging. Laboratory experiments and a field tagging study were performed to investigate habitat preference in juvenile lingcod. Initial laboratory experiments demonstrated an affinity for structure (rock, shell, or seagrass) over bare sand habitats. An acoustic tagging study conducted in Yaquina Bay, Oregon, corroborated the basic habitat preferences seen in laboratory experiments. Juvenile lingcod showed a high degree of site fidelity, remaining in discreet areas of significant structural complexity, as evidenced by underwater video of benthic habitat. Results from both laboratory and field studies establish that juvenile lingeod preferentially use structurally complex habitats.

We assessed ecosystem and trophic connectivity of two common reef fishes (schoolmaster, Lut-janus apodus; white grunt, Haemulon plumierii) and one predator (great barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda) in a Caribbean MSP ecosystem using acoustic telemetry and natural dietary tracers. Triangulated positions from an acoustic positioning system indicated that L. apodus and H. plumierii relied on multiple habitats within this MSP ecosystem, occupying areas with more cover (lower risk) during the day and areas with less cover (higher risk) at night. During the day, both species exhibited limited movement away from structured habitats (e.g., mangroves, patch reef) and avoided the primary activity space of S. barracuda in the central channel over sand bottom or seagrass. At night, L. apodus moved into the channel and adjacent seagrass beds on the margin of this high-risk area when S. barracuda occurrence was reduced, suggesting that this species adjusts its foraging activities to minimize encounter rates with predators. Haemulon plumierii also displayed distinct day-night shifts with directed movements at twilight across higher risk habitat to nighttime locations in seagrass. Conspicuous changes in the rate of movement were also detected at different times of the day, and observed mismatches between movement rates of S. barracuda and our two potential prey species appeared to be a behavioral response to reduce their vulnerability. Dietary tracer analysis supported the premise that observed shifts to nocturnal habitats were associated with foraging, with significant contributions of organic matter derived from nighttime locations. Findings from this study clearly demonstrate that the configuration of habitats and spatiotemporal variability in predation risk are key determinants of movement and foraging activities for these species, indicating that an improved understanding of seascape connectivity is critical to the management of reef-dependent species.","[Rooker, Jay R.; Dance, Michael A.; Wells, R.

In Pohnpei, Micronesia, reproductively active brown-marbled grouper were tagged with acoustic and spaghetti-type tags at a multi-species fish spawning aggregation (FSA) site to establish patterns of movement, residency and seasonality. Telemetry confirmed the use of common reproductive migratory corridors and significant sex-specific variations in residency at the FSA. Combined underwater visual census and telemetry data verified a 3-month peak aggregation period, with aggregations forming and persisting over ca. 12 days prior to full moon between January and May. FSA formation coincided with seasonally low and relatively stable seawater temperatures. Some males frequented the FSA site during each aggregation month over two consecutive years. Conversely, most females were present at the FSA during only a single aggregation period, with the month of visitation consistent among years. Nearly two-thirds of tagged fish were relocated or recaptured within 11 km of the aggregation site, with a maximum detected distance of 26 km and a minimum estimated catchment area of 100-175 km(2). Findings highlight the need for a combined approach to management that prohibits the capture and sale of reproductive adults and protects both spawning sites and common reproductive migratory corridors during aggregation periods.","[Rhodes, K.

Fish detected, during both the seasons showed strong fidelity for the study area before and during the spawning season and their home range did not differ between seasons. Home ranges reached an asymptote between 12 and 174 days after release.

The variability in the movement patterns of D. vulgaris was lower between seasons (i.e., during and outside the spawning season) than at smaller temporal scale (i.e., between day and night) and was largely affected by inter-individual differences.

We used acoustic telemetry to document their residency and movements in the nearshore waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska in order to assess use of created reef habitat in an individual-based manner. A total of 57 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Forty-five fish were captured and monitored in three habitats: artificial reef, low-relief natural reef, and patchy high-relief natural reef. Within each habitat, both rockfish and lingcod exhibited long periods of residency with limited movements. Twelve rockfish were captured at the natural reefs and displaced a distance of 4.0 km to the artificial reef. Five of the 12 rockfish returned within 10 d of their release to their initial capture site. Another five of the 12 displaced fish established residency at the artificial reef through the duration of our study.

Fifteen P. areolatus were acoustically tagged and re-located within a ca. 50 km(2) search area over a 4-month period that included reproductive and non-reproductive months. All relocated fish were found in areas of moderate to high coral cover either on the fore reef or inside the lagoon in home ranges of 0.048 +/- A 0.018 km(2) (mu +/- A S.E.). Variability in home range area (0.004-0.12 km(2)) and distance of movement from aggregation sites following spawning (0.02-23.0 km; 5.3 +/- A 3.6 km, mu +/- A S.E.) was observed, but did not appear to be sex specific. Five of the six relocated individuals were found within 0.02-6.1 km of the aggregation. This evidence and that from recent tag-recapture studies of epinephelids suggest that a substantial proportion of individual P. areolatus spawning populations reside within close proximity to their respective aggregation sites.

Soniferous species require specific acoustic and physical conditions suitable for their signals to be transmitted, received, and effectively interpreted to successfully identify and utilize resources in their environment and interact with conspecifics and other heterospecific organisms. We propose the Acoustic Habitat Hypothesis to explain how the acoustic environment influences habitat selection of sound-dependent species. We postulate that sound-dependent species select and occupy habitats with unique acoustic characteristics that are essential to their functional needs and conducive to the threshold of sound frequency they produce and detect. These acoustic habitats are based on the composition of biophony, geophony, and technophony in the soundscape and on the biosemiotics mechanisms described in the eco-field hypothesis. The Acoustic Habitat Hypothesis initiates questions of habitat selection that go beyond the physical attributes of the environment by applying ecoacoustics theory. We outline the theoretical basis of the Acoustic Habitat Hypothesis and provide examples from the literature to support its assumptions. The concept of acoustic habitats has been documented in the literature for many years but here, we accurately and extensively define acoustic habitat and we put this concept into a unified theory. We also include perspectives on how the Acoustic Habitat Hypothesis can stimulate a paradigm shift in conservation strategies for threatened and endangered species.","[Mullet, Timothy C.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Ecol Serv, 1208 B Main St, Daphne, AL 36526 USA; [Farina, Almo] Univ Urbino, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, I-61029 Urbino, Italy; [Gage, Stuart H.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, Global Observ Ecosyst Serv, 101 Manly Miles Bldg,1405 South Harrison Rd, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service; University of Urbino; Michigan State University,"Mullet, TC (corresponding author), US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Ecol Serv, 1208 B Main St, Daphne, AL 36526 USA.",tcmullet@yahoo.com,"Mullet, Timothy/AAA-2739-2021","Mullet, Timothy/0000-0002-9565-0668",International Society of Ecoacoustics,International Society of Ecoacoustics,"We thank Bernie Krause, Jerome Sueur, and Dimitrios Bormpoudakis for their support and discussions on the topic of acoustic habitats.

In typical fishery management efforts, fish populations are often treated as homogeneous units, thereby tacitly ignoring potential intrapopulation variation within taxonomic groupings. We used acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to examine movement patterns of 20 gray snapper Lutjanus griseus and 20 schoolmaster snapper L. apodus in a Bahamian tidal creek and wetland. In particular, we examined (1) if intrapopulation variation in fish habitat use and movement patterns existed, (2) whether that variation was a function of body size, and (3) if there was evidence of specialization in habitat use among individuals. We found that movement varied substantially among individuals, but was independent of body size. Some individuals exhibited frequent, repeated, movements to certain areas of the study site. delta C-13 values of individual snapper were significantly related to movement metrics, suggesting that movement differences were related to specific patterns of foraging behavior. Our findings suggest the importance of incorporating intrapopulation niche variation-a source of variation that is often overlooked in traditional conservation and management strategies-into the study of coastal fish populations.","[Hammerschlag-Peyer, Caroline M.; Layman, Craig A.] Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, Dept Biol Sci, N Miami, FL 33181 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Hammerschlag-Peyer, CM (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, N Miami, FL 33181 USA.",cpeye001@fiu.edu,,,"NSF OCE [0746164]; NSF DEB [0842196]; MacTaggart Third Fund, Friends of the Environment (Abaco); Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [0842196] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF OCE(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); MacTaggart Third Fund, Friends of the Environment (Abaco); Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This project was conducted as part of a broad educational outreach program funded by NSF OCE #0746164, NSF DEB #0842196, the MacTaggart Third Fund, Friends of the Environment (Abaco), and the Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation.

Many researchers have used ad hoc attachment methods and provided little or no validation for the assumption that tagging itself does not bias animal behaviour or survival. The authors compared six previously published methods for externally attaching acoustic transmitters to fish in a tank holding experiment with black sea bass Centropristis striata (L.). They tracked tag retention, fish growth and external trauma (as a measure of fish welfare) for 60 days. For each of these metrics, the results showed a wide range of responses among tagging treatments. A simple attachment method using a spaghetti tag passed through the dorsal musculature of the fish and tied to the end cap of the transmitter emerged as the preferred option based on high retention, no impact on growth and relatively low detriment to fish welfare. Future field studies using external electronic tagging should consider tag-related effects that could compromise results when selecting a method for tag attachment.","[Runde, Brendan J.; Buckel, Jeffrey A.; Tharp, Ryan M.; Rudershausen, Paul J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Bacheler, Nathan M.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC USA; [Harms, Craig A.; Ben-Horin, Tal] North Carolina State Univ, Coll Vet Med, Dept Clin Sci, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC USA",North Carolina State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; North Carolina State University,"Runde, BJ (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA.",bjrunde@ncsu.edu,"Runde, Brendan/KYP-9925-2024","Harms, Craig/0000-0002-1262-9274; Ben-Horin, Tal/0000-0001-5123-2643; Buckel, Jeffrey A/0009-0002-9409-8864; Runde, Brendan/0000-0002-2125-4486",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Saltonstall-Kennedy Program [NA17NMF4270204],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Saltonstall-Kennedy Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Funding for this work was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Saltonstall-Kennedy Program (NA17NMF4270204).

Tagging stress can slow and disorient the fish upon release, and reduce the ability to return to depth, relocate their home habitat site, and evade predators. To reduce these initial tag and release artifacts we designed and tested a remotely opening cage for use with reef fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Our objectives were to quickly return transmitter tagged fish to depth (20-30 m) in close proximity (<10 m) to their capture site, and to increase survival by providing predator protection during an initial recovery period. This cage release method proved successful for both red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus; n=62 out of 71, 87%) and all gray triggerfish (Batistes capriscus; n=24) that were tagged and released on artificial reefs. All tagged fish were released from November 2012 to September 2014, no initial tag induced mortalities were observed, and after tagging fish were successfully tracked for extended periods (for the entire 2 year study period).

Range testing and visual observations revealed the limitations of using small acoustic transmitters to monitor movements of small coral reef fish in a topographically complex and noisy coral reef environment. Visual observations of conventionally tagged and albino fish suggest individuals return each day to forage over the same few hundred m(2) of shallow, turf algae dominated boulder and reef flat habitat for periods of at least weeks to months. Acoustic telemetry data suggest lower frequency of repeated use of daytime foraging, nighttime refuge and sunset spawning sites. However, integration of observation and acoustic telemetry data revealed that many fish were not detected while they were within the empirically tested range of the receivers. These observations indicate that data from passive acoustic telemetry can underestimate the frequency and duration of repeated use of specific areas. Yellow tang adults made daily crepuscular migrations of up to 600 m between foraging and spawning or sheltering sites at consistent times relative to sunset and sunrise. While there was high individual variability in migration distance, almost all individuals moved in the same direction (from south to north) at sunset.

Once relatively common throughout Florida and the Caribbean, the species; is now considered vulnerable (i.e., threatened with extinction) due to overfishing and loss of juvenile mangrove habitat. Goliath grouper in the southeastern US form annual spawning aggregations on high-relief reefs located offshore of both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida, US. To determine spawning site fidelity and describe migration patterns to aggregations, we implanted 50 adult goliath grouper with acoustic transmitter tags from 2010 to 2013. Fish were tagged at known spawning sites off the Florida Atlantic coast and tracked as they moved through the FACT Network array of acoustic receivers. From 2010 to 2020, we collected similar to 7 million detections from tagged goliath grouper at 153 sites along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. Results of this long-term tracking indicate that adult goliath grouper are relatively sedentary during non-spawning months (Nov to June) but move significantly more prior to, during, and immediately after spawning (July to Oct). Inter-annual spawning site fidelity was high: between 80-93% of tagged fish returned to the same spawning sites each year. Arrival timing at spawning sites coincided with the August new moon, with males arriving earlier than females. Some individuals migrated distances greater than 400-km per year, with observed migration rates of up to 44-km per day prior to spawning. Long-term tagging data are critical for understanding movement patterns and developing management strategies for this species of special conservation concern.","[Ellis, Robert D.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Koenig, Christopher C.; Coleman, Felicia C.] Florida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, 3618 Coastal Highway, St Theresa, FL 32358 USA; [Locascio, James V.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Malinowski, Christopher R.] Ocean First Inst, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA",Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium,"Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",robert.ellis@myfwc.com; ckoenig@fsu.edu; locascio@mote.org; chris@oceanfirstinstitute.org; fcoleman@fsu.edu,"Coleman, Felicia/IAN-6791-2023","Coleman, Felicia/0000-0001-6286-9471; Ellis, Robert/0000-0001-7178-8980","This project would not have been possible without the vital advice and assistance of Captains Don Demaria and Mike Newman (F/V Dykoke).

The yellowmouth barracuda Sphyraena viridensis and the almaco jack Seriola rivoliana are the 2 most abundant bentho-pelagic reef predators in the Azores archipelago (central North Atlantic). They aggregate at shallow offshore seamounts, and largely share diet preferences, but very little is known about how habitat and resources are shared by these predators intra- and inter-specifically. Here we use long-term (over 3 yr) passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the patterns of activity, space use and associative behaviour at an isolated, small shallow seamount. By quantifying fine-scale spatiotemporal overlaps and performing null model randomization tests, we found evidence of non-random associations, mostly between conspecifics of both species, as well as shifts in diel and seasonal patterns of space occupancy. Both species were detected more often during spring, and appear to be more active during daytime, suggesting the absence of fine-scale temporal habitat partitioning. Additionally, we found evidence of size-dependent spatial behaviour in almaco jack, with similarly sized individuals co-occurring more often and larger specimens being more infrequently detected. This study quantitatively assesses individual associations using solely presence-absence data collected through passive acoustic telemetry, showing the potential of this approach in a broader application to a significant number of past and ongoing studies, even if many were not originally designed to study this important aspect of fish ecology.","[Gandra, Miguel] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res IMAR, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge] Univ Azores, OKEANOS UAc, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores,"Gandra, M (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",m3gandra@gmail.com,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Gandra, Miguel/0000-0003-1506-5141","project MARMACII [INTERREG/05/MAC/4.2/A4]; project SEAMOV [PTDC/MAR/1082 32/2008]; project MoniZEC [DRCT/0281M2.1.2/I/018/2011]; FCT/MCTES; DRCT Reequipamento programs; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UID/MAR/04292/2013, IF/01640/2015, SFRH/BPD/66532/2009]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/66532/2009] Funding Source: FCT",project MARMACII; project SEAMOV; project MoniZEC; FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); DRCT Reequipamento programs; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank T.

Quantifying home range is critical for conservation, and can enable the use of concepts such as 'umbrella species', whose conservation protects other species due to shared habitat. To determine the value of the humphead wrasse as an umbrella species for coral reef conservation, we conducted a multi-year study of humphead wrasse home range at Palmyra Atoll, Central Tropical Pacific, tagging juvenile, female, and male individuals with acoustic transmitters. We quantified home range using 2 metrics, length and area, and determined if these metrics were related to the sex and maturity status of the individual. We recorded individual movements during 5030 fish days, yielding detailed records for 14 individuals comprising 3 juveniles, 5 females, and 6 males. The home range of humphead wrasse measured over a 2 yr study was 0.4 to 14 km and changed with ontogeny. Females had larger home ranges than other reef fishes studied to date (n = 68), indicating value as an umbrella species for coral reefs. We compared the home range of the species to the size distribution of tropical marine protected areas (MPAs), and used a model to estimate the MPA length necessary to retain humphead wrasse. Most MPAs are too small to effectively protect the humphead wrasse.","[Weng, Kevin C.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Pedersen, Martin W.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Del Raye, Gen A.; Gray, Andrew E.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Pelag Fisheries Res Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Technical University of Denmark; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Weng, KC (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",kevinweng@vims.edu,"Gray, Andrew/LCU-3798-2024; Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/C-4709-2013","Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/0000-0002-7069-7152","NOAA's Undersea Research Program; Coral Reef Conservation Program; Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory [NA05OAR4301108, NA09OAR43002]; Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR) [NA09OAR4320075]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA09OAR4320075]",NOAA's Undersea Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Coral Reef Conservation Program; Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory; Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Research at Palmyra Atoll was funded by a grant to K.C.W. from NOAA's Undersea Research Program and Coral Reef Conservation Program, and the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory pursuant to Project Number NA05OAR4301108 and NA09OAR43002.

For tropical small-scale fisheries, spatial scales of socially appropriate management are generally small-the median no-take locally managed marine area (LMMA) area throughout the Pacific is less than 1 km(2). This is of particular concern for large coral reef fishes, such as many species of grouper, which migrate to aggregations to spawn. Current data suggest that the catchment areas (i.e. total area from which individuals are drawn) of such aggregations are at spatial scales that preclude effective community-based management with no-take LMMAs. We used acoustic telemetry and tag-returns to examine reproductive migrations and catchment areas of the grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus at a spawning aggregation in Papua New Guinea. Protection of the resultant catchment area of approximately 16 km(2) using a no-take LMMA is socially untenable here and throughout much of the Pacific region. However, we found that spawning migrations were skewed towards shorter distances. Consequently, expanding the current 0.2 km(2) no-take LMMA to 1-2 km(2) would protect approximately 30-50% of the spawning population throughout the non-spawning season. Contrasting with current knowledge, our results demonstrate that species with moderate reproductive migrations can be managed at scales congruous with spatially restricted management tools.","[Waldie, Peter A.; Almany, Glenn R.; Hamilton, Richard J.; Robinson, Jan; Cinner, Joshua E.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Almany, Glenn R.] UPVD, CNRS, EPHE, CRIOBE,USR 3278, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Almany, Glenn R.] Lab Excellence CORAIL, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Sinclair-Taylor, Tane H.; Priest, Mark A.; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Hamilton, Richard J.] Nature Conservancy, Indopacific Div, South Brisbane, Australia; [Potuku, Tapas] Nature Conservancy, Kavieng Field Off, Kavieng, Papua N Guinea; [Priest, Mark A.] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Priest, Mark A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Rhodes, Kevin L.] MarAlliance, POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize",James Cook University; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Nature Conservancy; Nature Conservancy; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Waldie, PA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",peter.waldie@gmail.com,"Waldie, Peter/J-3896-2019; Cinner, Joshua/E-8966-2011; Sinclair-Taylor, Tane/AAN-5684-2020; Berumen, Michael/F-7745-2011","Waldie, Peter/0000-0002-9153-5638; Hamilton, Richard/0000-0002-0076-4276; Berumen, Michael/0000-0003-2463-2742; Cinner, Joshua/0000-0003-2675-9317; Sinclair-Taylor, Tane/0000-0003-4240-0435","Australian Research Council (ARC), ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Nature Conservancy, Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); KAUST Red Sea Research Center","Australian Research Council (ARC), ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council); Nature Conservancy, Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); KAUST Red Sea Research Center(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)","Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council (ARC), ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, The Nature Conservancy, Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation.

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to determine home ranges of six adult L. analis, including diel patterns, in Brewers Bay, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Understanding long-term space use, including site fidelity and habitat usage, is necessary to implement effective and appropriate management actions for a species with extensive space and resource needs.ResultsIndividual L. analis were tracked over an average period of 316 days (range 125-509 days) and showed high site fidelity to relatively small home ranges (meanSD: 0.103 +/- 0.028 km(2), range 0.019-0.190 km(2)) and core use areas with low overlap among individuals. Most home ranges had a habitat composition dominated by seagrass and to a lesser degree, coral reef and/or pavement. Nighttime activity spaces were distinct from but contained within daytime areas. Conclusions: Mutton snapper showed strong site fidelity to home ranges in Brewers Bay. Two individuals that were absent from the array for more than a few hours were detected at separate arrays at spawning aggregation sites. This study expands upon knowledge of mutton snapper home range characteristics, highlights the importance of maintaining adjacent high-quality habitat types in any spatial management plan, and encourages the adoption of other types of management strategies, particularly for transient-aggregating species.","[Heidmann, Sarah L.; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Jossart, Jonathan] CSS, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Kimble, Melissa] Univ Maine, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA","University of the Virgin Islands; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

Males defend territories to attract mates in a lek-like reproductive strategy. Prior studies have documented rapid declines in populations with FSA-associated fisheries. This study examines the migratory behavior of adult male Tiger Grouper in Little Cayman, Cayman Islands, to better understand the impacts of aggregation fishing. As part of the Grouper Moon Project, we acoustically tagged ten spawning male Tiger Grouper at the western end of Little Cayman in February 2015. Using a hydrophone array surrounding the island, we tracked the movements of the tagged fish for 13 months. We observed 3 migratory strategies: resident fish (n = 2) that live at the FSA site, neighboring fish (n = 5) that live within 4 km of the site, and commuter fish (n = 3) that travel over 4 km for spawning. Fish began aggregating 2 days before the full moon and left 10-12 days after the full moon, from January to May. Regardless of migratory strategy, all tagged fish that aggregated after February 2015 returned to the west end FSA. However, in January 2016, one fish appeared to attend a different FSA closer to its presumed home territory. Tiger Grouper may establish multiple FSAs around Little Cayman, and males appear to attend FSAs near their home territories. Protracted spawning seasons, FSA site infidelity, and putative FSA catchments should all be considered to ensure sustainable fisheries management for this important species.","[Sleugh, Toni; Waterhouse, Lynn; Stock, Brian C.; Semmens, Brice X.] Univ Calif La Jolla, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [McCoy, Croy M.; Johnson, Bradley C.] Cayman Isl Govt, Dept Environm, 1002,Grand Cayman KY1, George Town, Cayman Islands; [Pattengill-Semmens, Christy V.] Reef Environm Educ Fdn REEF, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA; [Heppell, Scott A.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries Wildlife & Conservat Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Waterhouse, Lynn] Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Stock, Brian C.] Inst Marine Res, Nye Flodevigveien 20, N-4817 His, Norway",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Oregon State University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Institute of Marine Research - Norway,"Semmens, BX (corresponding author), Univ Calif La Jolla, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",bsemmens@ucsd.edu,,"Stock, Brian/0000-0002-2393-6747; Semmens, Brice/0000-0001-5663-9194; Heppell, Scott/0000-0003-1387-8181; McCoy, Croy/0000-0001-6433-6775; Pattengill-Semmens, Christy/0000-0001-5255-6033; Sleugh, Toni/0000-0001-6328-6163; Waterhouse, Lynn/0000-0002-7455-7632",Disney Conservation Fund; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program [DGE-2038238],Disney Conservation Fund; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank the many research divers and volunteers who have participated in and supported the REEF/CIDOE Grouper Moon Project.

A comprehensive array of acoustic receivers was deployed at two near-shore coastal sites in south-eastern Australia, to examine the movements, activity-space size and residency of a temperate rocky-reef, herbivorous species Girella elevata. Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure. The results from the present study will further contribute to the spatial information required in the zoning of effective marine protected areas, and our understanding of temperate reef fish ecology.","[Stocks, Jerom R.; Gray, Charles A.; Taylor, Matthew D.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stocks, Jerom R.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Batemans Bay Fisheries Ctr, Batemans Bay, NSW 2536, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW 2316, Australia; [Gray, Charles A.] WildFish Res, Sydney, NSW 2232, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Stocks, JR (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jerom.stocks@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Stocks, Jerom/N-9315-2016","Gray, Charles/0000-0001-9939-9995; Stocks, Jerom/0000-0001-6425-8869",Integrated Marine Observing System; Australian Animal Tagging and Monitoring System; NSW Saltwater Recreational Fishing Trust; Fisheries NSW; University of NSW,Integrated Marine Observing System; Australian Animal Tagging and Monitoring System; NSW Saltwater Recreational Fishing Trust; Fisheries NSW; University of NSW,"We thank personnel from the University of New South Wales and Fisheries NSW who provided technical advice, including Dylan Van der Meulen and Nicholas Payne.

We evaluated spotted seatrout Cynoscion nebulosus spawning site fidelity and reproductive timing at both the population and individual level at a resident spawning aggregation site. Because males make sounds associated with courtship, we were able to use aggregation sound as an indicator of population spawning activity, monitoring sound at this site with passive acoustics. To assess individuals, we acoustically tagged and released 32 (19 male, 13 female) fish and monitored the spatio-temporal patterns of their movements with a high-density receiver array. Both aggregation sound and detections of tagged fish indicated a truncated spawning season in 2005, apparently due to a persistent red tide event. Individuals exhibited strong intra-seasonal site fidelity, with 23 tagged fish returning to the site to spawn. Most of the fish spawning at this site were drawn from the estuary and returned to the estuary within a 24 h cycle. However, there was individual variability in this spatio-temporal behavior. Aggregation sound indicated daily spawning at this site, but not by the same individuals. Individual estimates of spawning indicated that males spawned more frequently than females (average spawning interval of 2.2 d compared to 9.3 d for females), and that individuals exhibited variability in the time period between spawning events. The probability of an individual spawning at this site was significantly affected by sex and lunar phase (spawning increased on dates near the full moon), but not by current speed or direction.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Walters, Sarah; Bickford, Joel; Cooper, Wade; Muller, Robert] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission,"Lowerre-Barbieri, SK (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",susan.barbieri@myfwc.com,"Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/JOZ-3798-2023; Mueller, Robert/KBQ-0958-2024","Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/0000-0001-5146-3257",US Fish and Wildlife Service Sport Fish Restoration program [F-59],US Fish and Wildlife Service Sport Fish Restoration program(US Fish & Wildlife Service),"We thank D.

Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0-0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had significant effects on ODBA and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to differing feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily influence red snapper and that they behave differently on specific habitat types at certain times. Future efforts to examine the ecological performance of red snapper across reef types should therefore carefully take environmental influences into account.","[Getz, Ethan T.; Kline, Richard J.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Brownsville, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Kline, RJ (corresponding author), One West Univ Blvd, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.",richard.kline@utrgv.edu,,"Kline, Richard/0000-0002-4116-2060","Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Artificial Reef Program, USA [475342]","Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Artificial Reef Program, USA","We thank Marlin Gregor and Sonotronics Inc. for assistance and expertise in the design and programming of the telemetry tags used in this study.

Interindividual variability was detected for both spatial and temporal patterns. There were 2 principal movement behaviours that were recorded, with some individuals showing high site fidelity and others showing a more mobile behaviour, moving out from the monitoring area. Observation-area curves indicated that a period between 3 and 5 d was required to determine home ranges of the sedentary fish. Home range sizes were small, with a minimum shift of core areas occurring on a daily basis. Total minimum convex polygon (MCP) areas ranged between 0.102 and 0.671 km(2), whereas 95 % kernel utilization distributions (KUD) ranged between 0.760 and 1.333 km(2). Core areas (50% KUD) ranged between 0.175 and 0.294 km(2). There were no significant differences in home range patterns between day and night periods. However, the use of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) revealed diel rhythms on the detection pattern that could be related to a resting behaviour at night. Estimation of home ranges of S. scriba agrees with the sedentary habits of the Serranidae family and suggests the potential use of MPAs for the sustainable development of the fishery of this small Serranid.","[March, D.; Palmer, M.; Alos, J.; Cardona, F.] UIB CSIC, IMEDEA, Esporles 07190, Islas Baleares, Spain; [Grau, A.] LIMIA, Port Dandratx 07157, Islas Baleares, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"March, D (corresponding author), UIB CSIC, IMEDEA, Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Islas Baleares, Spain.",david.march@uib.es,"Palmer, Miquel/E-3561-2013; March, David/G-6489-2014","Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539; Miquel, Palmer/0000-0002-7875-3673; March, David/0000-0002-6118-761X; Grau, Amalia/0000-0002-6461-6985","Sonotronics Inc; Spanish Ministry of Research and Science [CTM2005-00283, BES-2006-13252]; Government of the Balearic Islands",Sonotronics Inc; Spanish Ministry of Research and Science(Spanish Government); Government of the Balearic Islands,"We thank the many people that collaborated in this project, particularly A.M.

This review provides the most current summary from primary and grey literature on the biology and ecology of several coastal fishes of economic and ecological significance in south-east Australia; identifies key knowledge gaps which may impede the development of effective spatial management; and recommends future research directions and methods. Reviewed species are luderick (Girella tricuspidata), eastern rock blackfish (Girella elevata), yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), tarwhine (Rhabdosargus sarba), snapper (Pagrus auratus), red morwong (Cheilodactylus fuscus) and eastern blue grouper (Achoerodus viridis). The species have a diverse range of life-histories and population traits, and selected parameters were well studied in several species, such as growth (blue groper, luderick, yellowfin bream, tarwhine, snapper), post-settlement movement (red morwong), and larval ecology (yellowfin bream). However, empirical data on levels of pre- and post-settlement connectivity and real-time movements are not available for most species, and this represents a significant gap for improved spatial management. A multidisciplinary approach incorporating a range of methods including acoustic tracking and telemetry, otolith chemistry, intergenerational markers, and biophysical modelling will provide a more comprehensive understanding of life history parameters, movement and connectivity at scales relevant to MPA planning and monitoring.","[Curley, Belinda G.; Figueira, Will F.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia; [Curley, Belinda G.; Jordan, Alan R.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia; [Figueira, Will F.] Univ Sydney, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Valenzuela, Vanessa C.] Univ Technol Sydney, Dept Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Sydney Institute of Marine Science; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; University of Sydney; University of Technology Sydney,"Curley, BG (corresponding author), Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Bldg 22,Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia.",belinda.curley@sims.org.au,"Figueira, Will/A-5163-2009","Figueira, Will/0000-0001-9472-8710",NSW Marine Parks Authority; NSW Department of Primary Industries,NSW Marine Parks Authority; NSW Department of Primary Industries,"The authors thank N.

The occurrence patterns of the target fishes both inside and outside the MPA were also observed. Thirty individuals from 6 species (20.2 to 41.4 cm fork length) were caught, acoustically tagged and released inside the MPA, and 4 to 210 d of tracking data were then obtained from 28 detected fishes. Lutjanus monostigma, Lethrinus atkinsoni, and Lethrinus obsoletus were found to mostly inhabit the coral reef. The remaining 3 species (Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Lethrinus harak, and Siganus guttatus) utilized both coral and seagrass habitats but showed different patterns: Lutjanus argentimaculatus visited seagrass only at night; Lethrinus harak occurred in the coral reef more at night than in the day, showing the opposite pattern in seagrass; and S. guttatus exhibited the converse pattern to L. harak. More than one-third of the tracked individuals moved inside and outside the MPA more than once per day on average during the tracking period. However, 95.4% of detections were recorded by acoustic receivers deployed inside the MPA. Underwater visual surveys revealed that the densities of some target fishes were significantly higher inside than outside the MPA. These findings suggest that the MPA protects the core of fish home ranges.","[Honda, Kentaro; Nakaoka, Masahiro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Akkeshi Marine Stn, Akkeshi, Hokkaido 0881114, Japan; [Uy, Wilfredo H.; Baslot, Darwin I.; Pantallano, Allyn Duvin S.] Mindanao State Univ Naawan, Inst Fisheries Res & Dev, Naawan 9023, Misamis Orienta, Philippines; [Nakamura, Yohei] Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Kuroshio Sci, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan",Hokkaido University; Mindanao State University System; Mindanao State University-Naawan; Kochi University,"Honda, K (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Agcy, Hokkaido Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Toyohira Ku, 2-2 Nakanoshima, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0620922, Japan.",fbmods@affrc.go.jp,"Nakaoka, Masahiro/I-9237-2019; Uy, Wilfredo/AAP-6316-2021","Uy, Wilfredo/0000-0002-4019-0385; Nakamura, Yohei/0000-0002-2412-2139; Honda, Kentaro/0000-0003-1967-9263; Nakaoka, Masahiro/0000-0002-5722-3585",Japan Science and Technology Agency,Japan Science and Technology Agency(Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST)),"We thank the local government unit and fisherfolk of Barangay Tubajon, Laguindingan, particularly D.

Tagging data showed that adult carpenter were mainly resident, with a small proportion (7%) leaving the TNP in both easterly and westerly directions. There was no relationship between fish movement patterns and fish size or time-at-liberty. Current patterns suggest that eggs and larvae spawned within the TNP are mainly transported eastwards towards established nursery grounds; the median estimated distance moved was 299 km (range 42-561 km) in 30 days (time to flexion). Given this pattern of ichthyoplankton dispersal, together with the fact that adult carpenter within the TNP displayed a high degree of residency and that they are much more abundant than in adjacent fishing grounds (catch per unit effort being 23 times greater), it appears that the TNP protects a viable carpenter spawner population capable of seeding adjacent fishing grounds.","Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa; Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Brouwer, SL (corresponding author), Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Private Bag X2, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa.",,,,,,,,24,19,21,0,3,DEPT ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS & TOURISM,CAPE TOWN,"MARINE & COASTAL MANAGEMENT, PRIVATE BAG X2, ROGGIE BAY 8012, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA",0257-7615,,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

We acclimated four 1-year-old fish to shelters in cages before release and compared their movements with six nonacclimated fish. Since it was not possible to compare the behavioral pattern between the former and the latter fish due to the short periods the latter fish were available to be monitored, we also compared their movements with those of large nonacclimated fish that were less likely to be preyed upon. Sixty-seven percent of the nonacclimated fish showed atypical movements before the signals ceased to be detected, a pattern that suggested a predation event had occurred, whereas none of the acclimated and large nonacclimated fish showed the atypical movements. In addition, the probability of detection cessation was about 13 times lower in the acclimated than nonacclimated fish. The signal detection patterns suggest that the acclimated fish utilized night-time shelters from the first night after release, while the large nonacclimated fish started to utilize shelters several days after release. Therefore, it is likely that the shelter acclimation enhanced the shelter utilization by tuskfish, possibly decreasing post-release predation mortality.","[Kawabata, Yuuki; Arai, Nobuaki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Asami, Kimio; Kobayashi, Masato; Sato, Taku; Okuzawa, Koichi; Yamada, Hideaki; Yoseda, Kenzo] Fisheries Res Agcy, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Okinawa 9070451, Japan; [Asami, Kimio; Yoseda, Kenzo] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries & Environm Inland Sea, Hiroshima 7390452, Japan; [Okuzawa, Koichi] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Aquaculture, Minamiise, Mie 5160193, Japan",Kyoto University; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Kawabata, Y (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Inst E China Sea Res, Taira, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan.",yukikawabata0202@yahoo.co.jp,"Kawabata, Yuuki/H-4109-2019; Okuzawa, Koichi/J-2677-2012","Okuzawa, Koichi/0000-0002-0172-1008","Kyoto University, Information Education and Research Center; Fisheries Research Agency, Japan; [20-2242]","Kyoto University, Information Education and Research Center; Fisheries Research Agency, Japan;","We thank T.

Our study focused on three species (Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus microrhinos and Scarus ghobban), including a total of 30 fish. Fish were kept outside their natural environment for several days before release for pre- and post-tagging surveys. Moreover, 47% of them were not released at their capture site. Half of all individuals (all species) showed a high level of side fidelity immediately upon release. During this period, they were detected in the same place, by a small and constant number of hydrophones. This site fidelity pattern was also observed for the other fish (50%; all species) but after 1 to 18 days of an unsettled pattern, during which the fish moved significantly along the reef slope (high activity). During this short period, the distances travelled were significantly higher than during the subsequent period of site fidelity (several km vs. a few hundred m). We hypothesize that these unsettled patterns might result from fish experimental displacement (homing behavior) and from post-capture captivity (the fish had to recover a niche within the ecosystem). Consequently, we suggest that fish be released where they were caught to limit the movements associated with homing behavior. Periods of captivity should be avoided as much as possible. If this is not possible, a minimum acclimatization period of two or three weeks should be taken into account when analyzing the data.","[Chateau, Olivier] Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Wantiez, Laurent] Univ New Caledonia, CNRS, IFREMER, UMR,ENTROPIE,IRD,UR,UNC, Noumea, New Caledonia",Universite Nouvelle Caledonie; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ifremer,"Chateau, O (corresponding author), Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea, New Caledonia.",olivier.chateau@aquarium.nc,"Wantiez, Laurent/L-3343-2013","Wantiez, Laurent/0000-0001-5024-2057; CHATEAU, Olivier/0000-0003-1153-6284",ZoNeCo program (New Caledonia),ZoNeCo program (New Caledonia),Financial support for this study was provided by the ZoNeCo program (New Caledonia).Data availabilityThe material has not been previously published or simultaneously been submitted for publication elsewhere.,,27,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

These fish are susceptible to pressure-related injuries (i.e., barotrauma) during fishing that compromise survival after catch and release. Barotrauma-afflicted fish may not only experience immediate mortality but also delayed mortality after returning to depth. This variability and unknown fate leads to uncertainty in stock assessment models and rebuilding plans. To generate better estimates of immediate and delayed mortality and postrelease behavior, Red Snapper were tagged with ultrasonic acoustic transmitters fitted with acceleration and depth sensors. Unique behavior profiles were generated for each fish using these sensor data that allowed the classification of survival and delayed mortality events. Using this information, we compared the survival of Red Snapper released using venting, nonventing, and descending treatments over three seasons and two depths. Red Snapper survival was highest at cooler temperatures and shallower depths. Fish released using venting and descender tools had similar survival, and both these groups of fish had higher survival than nonvented surface-released fish. Overall, Red Snapper had 72% survival, 15% immediate mortality, and 13% delayed mortality, and all fish suffering from delayed mortality perished within a 72-h period after release. Results from these field studies enhance the understanding of the delayed mortality and postrelease fate of Red Snapper regulatory discards. Moreover, these data support the practice of using venting or descender devices to increase the survival of discarded Red Snapper in the recreational fishery and show that acoustic telemetry can be a valuable tool in estimating delayed mortality.","[Curtis, Judson M.; Johnson, Matthew W.; Stunz, Gregory W.] Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Diamond, Sandra L.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Diamond, Sandra L.] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Johnson, Matthew W.] Bur Ocean Energy Management, 1201 Elmwood Pk Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Western Sydney University,"Curtis, JM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",judd.curtis@tamucc.edu,"Johnson, Matthew/AAA-3299-2020",,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries Initiative [NA10NMF4330126],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries Initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank the many people that contributed to this study: members of the Fisheries and Ocean Health Lab at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies; M.

The temporal and spatial predictability of these migrations and spawning aggregation locations makes species vulnerable to overfishing, as the majority of an adult population within a large region may be harvested quickly with minimal effort. Historically, the Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus (Bloch, 1792), was an important fishery species throughout its range, but due to spawning aggregation overfishing, it is now rare in many reef ecosystems. In The Bahamas, stocks continue to decline despite the implementation of spawning aggregation protections. While more Nassau grouper spawning aggregations have been reported in The Bahamas than any other country, very few have been validated, and the dynamics of spawning migrations to and from these sites is poorly understood. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to describe, for the first time, Nassau grouper migrations along Andros Island, The Bahamas, which is bordered by one of the longest barrier reefs in the world. We report the likely extirpation of a historically important spawning aggregation and suggest Nassau grouper are migrating to a previously undocumented spawning location. Fish migrated in groups during the January 2015 full moon along the barrier reef shelf edge traveling roundtrip distances of 71.5-260.3 km [(x) over bar = 164.5 (SD 65.7) km, n = 9]. These results are critical to assess the efficacy of current management strategies in The Bahamas. Thus far, all known spaning aggregations have been reported to the scientific community by fishers. Data from our study, however, suggest the presence of a potential spawning aggregation informed by passive telemetry and warrants further investigation.","[Stump, Kristine; Sherman, Krista D.; Knapp, Charles R.] John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, 1200 South Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Dahlgren, Craig P.] BNT, Sci & Policy, POB N-4105, Nassau, Bahamas; [Dahlgren, Craig P.] Perry Inst Marine Sci, POB 435,5356 Route 100, Waitsfield, VT 05673 USA; [Sherman, Krista D.] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QD, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Knapp, CR (corresponding author), John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, 1200 South Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",cknapp@sheddaquarium.org,,"Sherman, Krista/0000-0001-9859-8781",John G Shedd Aquarium; Paul M Angell Foundation; Disney Conservation Fund's Reverse The Decline Initiative; Atlantis Blue Project Foundation; Moore Bahamas Foundation,John G Shedd Aquarium; Paul M Angell Foundation; Disney Conservation Fund's Reverse The Decline Initiative; Atlantis Blue Project Foundation; Moore Bahamas Foundation,"This work was supported by the John G Shedd Aquarium, including contributions from the Paul M Angell Foundation.

If individuals inside reserves behave differently to those outside, this information should be incorporated into reserve design and in management efforts to avoid the selective removal of certain behaviors. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, north-eastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types. One group had uni-modal home ranges that on average encompassed c.900 m linear distance. All nine residential snapper from the reserve displayed this behavior, as well as five of ten residential fish from the non-reserve area. The second group (five fish, all from the non-reserve area) had home ranges with two separate modes (bi-modal home ranges), which on average encompassed c.2 100 m linear distance. We suggest that some aspect of the marine reserve environment encourages extreme residency by either the modification of individual behaviors or through the removal of selective exploitation. If true this suggests that reserves and populations of exploited animals may become dependent on the life history characteristics of the individuals they encourage or select for.

This perception is challenged here through a combined analysis of multi-annual commercial landings, underwater visual census and telemetry data from acoustically tagged fish to investigate the long-term movement patterns and residency (up to 4 years) in a seamount marine reserve. Although the landing patterns suggested a strong seasonal variation in abundance, the visual census and the telemetry experiment results were consistent with year-round residency in the Azores. Barracudas occurred consistently in underwater census throughout the year, and most tagged fish were almost continuously detected at the seamounts for up to four consecutive years. Detection probability did, however, decrease over time and showed seasonal variability as tagged fish were less mobile with longer absences during summer and fall. Given the intrinsic vulnerability of fish aggregations to exploitation, our results highlight the need to protect shallow seamount habitats and preserve sexually mature fish aggregations and their reproductive potential, contributing to the sustainable management and conservation of these vulnerable ecosystems.","[Fontes, Jorge; Afonso, Pedro] Univ Azores, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Rua Prof Dr Frederico Machado, Horta, Azores, Portugal; [Fontes, Jorge; Afonso, Pedro] Univ Azores, Ctr IMAR, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Horta, Azores, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores,"Fontes, J (corresponding author), Univ Azores, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Rua Prof Dr Frederico Machado, Horta, Azores, Portugal.;Fontes, J (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Ctr IMAR, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Horta, Azores, Portugal.",jorge.mr.fontes@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532","IMAR-DOP/UAz; LARSyS by FCT/MCTES; DRCTC (OE, COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia)","IMAR-DOP/UAz; LARSyS by FCT/MCTES; DRCTC (OE, COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia)","This study was funded through the contributions of IMAR-DOP/UAz and LARSyS funded by FCT/MCTES and DRCTC (OE, COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia).

The behavior of fish around baited gears, however, is poorly understood despite its importance for estimating catchability. We used a fine-scale acoustic positioning system to elucidate the movement behaviors of 11 telemetered gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus around 54 baited fish traps deployed at a 37 m deep site in Raleigh Bay, North Carolina, USA. Median positional error rates from a reference transmitter were 1-2 m, suggesting fish positions were accurate and precise. Overall, 104 170 spatial positions were determined for gray triggerfish over the 42 d study. There were 27 instances of telemetered gray triggerfish responding to baited fish traps. These fish responded from initial distances up to 312 m (mean = 68 m) from traps and spent 4-95% (mean = 35%) of their time within 20 m of traps. Using generalized additive models, we determined that telemetered gray triggerfish were most likely to respond to baited traps when they were initially located close to (<100 m), and down-current from, baited traps. There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait. Our modeling approach is general, and could be used to quantify the behavior of myriad organisms around sampling gears in various types of aquatic systems.","[Bacheler, Nathan M.; Shertzer, Kyle W.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Buckel, Jeffrey A.; Rudershausen, Paul J.; Runde, Brendan J.] North Carolina State Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Ecol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; North Carolina State University,"Bacheler, NM (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.",nate.bacheler@noaa.gov,"Runde, Brendan/KYP-9925-2024","Buckel, Jeffrey A/0009-0002-9409-8864; Runde, Brendan/0000-0002-2125-4486",Marine Fisheries Initiative program of the US National Marine Fisheries Service,Marine Fisheries Initiative program of the US National Marine Fisheries Service,"We thank C.

The eastern blue groper, Achoerodus viridis, is a long-lived, protogynous hermaphrodite, and an iconic' marine species in eastern Australia, with several MPAs having been established specifically for their protection. Site fidelity, habitat use, and home range size were assessed for 29 adult eastern blue gropers monitored for up to 374days using passive acoustic telemetry within and around a small marine reserve. The fish exhibited long residency times and no movement was recorded between adjacent reefs, suggesting sand acts as a natural barrier to movement. Core ranges were calculated using 50% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) and estimated between 0.005 and 0.092km(2). Males had larger core ranges than females or fish of indeterminate sex. There was no statistical difference between the breeding/non-breeding seasons. Home ranges were calculated using 95% KUD and ranged between 0.03 and 0.54km(2). Home range size was largest for males and significantly larger for all sexes in the breeding season. Fish tagged in the no-take' area of the MPA had smaller home ranges than fish tagged in the area where fishing is permitted. This study indicates that even relatively small MPAs can provide effective protection for adult eastern blue groper, supporting the proposition that large reef dwellers with long residency times can be used as flagship species to gain public support for the designation of MPAs.

Five goatfish equipped with acoustic transmitters were tracked for up to 93 h each over 3-14 days. Daytime habitat use patterns of two of these fish were continuously monitored for one month using a fixed hydrophone hardwired to an onshore computer. Acoustically tagged fish showed consistent diel patterns of behavior, refuging in holes in the reef by day and moving over extensive areas of sand and coral rubble habitat at night. Remote monitoring of daytime habitat use by two goatfish revealed that the same daytime refuge was used by both fish for at least one month (the battery life of the transmitters). Home ranges of all fish were within the boundaries of the Coconut Island reserve suggesting that even small areas containing suitable habitat can make effective reserves for this species. A relatively low abundance of reproductive size P. porphyreus at Coconut Island in comparison with deeper areas may indicate an ontogenetic shift to deeper habitat in this species.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NESC, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021",,,,,,26,130,154,0,47,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Despite the important top-down pressure this species likely exerts on fish communities within its foraging territories, the specifics of spatial ecology remain relatively unknown. This study tracked 17 great barracuda throughout Buck Island Reef National Monument, a marine-protected area located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (17.786944 degrees N, - 64.620556 degrees W) from July 2014 to May 2016. Broad- and fine-scale acoustic telemetry was used to examine individual variability and study population patterns in residency, site fidelity, territoriality, and complexity of spatial use within home ranges. Network analysis of broad-scale data revealed spatial and temporal differentiation among the population in location of core use areas and showed that these areas contained multiple unique receiver groups or communities, a product of spatial or temporal variation within core activity spaces. Results from the fine-scale positioning system reinforced spatial and temporal partitioning in core use areas between individuals, indicating territorial behaviors, and showed evidence for both resident and transient movements. Preliminary fine-scale analysis also suggested diel variation in location of activity spaces. Although ubiquitous throughout all shallow water habitats, detection patterns for the study population appear to be influenced by high residency, territoriality, spatial partitioning, and diel variation. Understanding the complexities of individual space use is fundamental to ecologically founded and effective area-based spatial management frameworks at community scales.","[Becker, Sarah L.; Finn, John T.; Novak, Ashleigh J.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI USA; [Lundgren, Ian] NOAA Fisheries, Off Habitat Conservat, Habitat Protect Div, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Becker, SL; Jordaan, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",sarah.becker3@gmail.com; ajordaan@eco.umass.edu,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011; Becker, Sarah/0000-0001-5840-6079",University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Park Service; Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14],University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Park Service; Puerto Rico Sea Grant,"This research was funded by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, National Park Service, and Puerto Rico Sea Grant (Project Number R-101-2-14).",,63,13,18,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Despite this important ecological role, we have a poor understanding of the movement patterns of such large herbivorous fish, including Kyphosus bigibbus. Nineteen K. bigibbus captured near adjacent but distinct patch reefs were tagged with internal acoustic tags and their movements monitored for up to 20 months by an array of 60 acoustic receivers. Home-range estimates showed that movements of individuals from each patch reef encompassed different spatial extents and resulted in differences in habitat used by the two groups of fish. The average 50 and 95% kernel utilisation distribution for long-term resident fish was 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 1.61 +/- 0.30 km(2) respectively, ranges that represent the largest values for a herbivorous coral reef fish recorded to date. There was a significantly higher degree of fidelity among fish from the same school, and to particular patch reefs, despite the proximity of the reefs and substantial overlap between schools of conspecifics. A coefficient of sociality was used on pairs of fish and showed that there was no evidence that individuals were consistently detected together when they were detected by receivers away from their home reef. The variability of movement patterns among individuals of K. bigibbus results in an increased niche footprint for this important browser, potentially increasing reef resilience.","[Pillans, R.

The Republic of Palau recently created the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, a Marine Managed Area that was intended to conserve marine resources and enhance local pelagic fisheries. However, the capacity of the nation's domestic fishery to exploit pelagic species must be built to meet these objectives and, to this aim, the development of a coastal network of Fish Attracting Devices (FADs) has been proposed. To inform the development of the nation's FAD program, we used acoustic telemetry to study the movements of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) within Palau's existing FAD network. Subadult yellowfin tuna (50 - 79 cm FL) remained within the FAD network for up to 175 days and young-of-the-year yellowfin tuna spent significantly more time in association with FADs in comparison to year-1 fish. A network analysis suggests that the Ngardmau and Peleliu FADs were the most important components of the current FAD network, and a mixed effects Poisson generalized linear model indicated that the residency of yellowfin tuna to these FADs was significantly related to mooring depth and distance from the reef. These results provide a description of yellowfin tuna movements within Palau's FAD network and recommendations to improve the nation's FAD program that are also applicable to other Pacific Island nations and territories that desire to improve domestic access to pelagic fish stocks.","[Filous, Alexander; Mereb, Geory; Golbuu, Yimnang] Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror, Palau; [Filous, Alexander; Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA; [Griffin, Lucas; Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Lennox, Robert J.] Norwegian Res Ctr NORCE, Lab Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Bergen, Norway",University of Hawaii System; National Geographic Society; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE),"Filous, A (corresponding author), Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror, Palau.",afilous@hawaii.edu,,"Griffin, Lucas/0000-0002-8560-0683; Lennox, Robert/0000-0003-1010-0577; Danylchuk, Andy/0000-0002-8363-0782","Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea; Palau International Coral Reef Center; National Geographic Pristine Seas program","Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea; Palau International Coral Reef Center; National Geographic Pristine Seas program(National Geographic Society)","This study was funded by the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea, the Palau International Coral Reef Center, and the National Geographic Pristine Seas program.

Fine-scale acoustic telemetry tracking was used to ascertain the home range and habitat utilization of S. pulcher. Sixteen adult S. pulcher (26-38 cm SL) were surgically fitted with small acoustic transmitters and manually tracked for up to 144 h during multiple, 24-h periods between March 2001 and August 2002 within the Catalina Marine Science Center Marine Life Reserve (33 degrees 26'N; 118 degrees 29'W). A geographic information system was used to calculate home range sizes (95% kernel utilization distributions) and habitat use. Tracking of the first five fish over 24 h confirmed that S. pulcher were strictly diurnal, so the remaining 11 fish were tracked from 1 h before sunrise to 1 h after sunset. Home ranges varied greatly, from 938 to 82,070 m(2), with a mean (+/- SD) of 15,134 +/- 26,007 m(2). Variability in home range sizes among fish was attributed to differences in habitat shape (embayment vs. contiguous coastline) and to natural habitat boundaries (deep, sandy expanses) in adjacent areas within the reserve. There was a significant relationship between fish length and proportion of time spent in different habitats (sand vs. reef). S. pulcher were found within rocky-reef areas 54% of the time, and, within these areas, a greater percentage of daytime was spent in high-relief areas. Based on the relatively small size and persistence of home ranges of adult S. pulcher, no-take reserves, if they contain appropriate habitat, would provide adequate protection for their stocks.","Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",dtopping13@hotmail.com,,,,,,,43,113,153,0,38,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

However, most evidence of such movement has been inferred from density and size structure differences among these habitats in tropical waters. The aim of the present Study was to directly evaluate multiple habitat use by an ecologically and economically important reef fish, the gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, in subtropical waters. An integrated set of activities was conducted, including tagging and tracking of individuals and underwater video photography to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of movements among neighboring mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitats in the northern Florida Keys, USA. Results of ultrasonic acoustic and mini-archival tagging indicated that L. griseus exhibits: (1) a distinct diel migration pattern, whereby shallow seagrass beds; are frequented nocturnally and mangroves and other habitats with complex structure are occupied diurnally, and (2) bay-to-ocean movement, occurring during the known spawning season of L. griseus in this region. Video photography confirmed diel movement among seagrass and mangrove habitats. Results of this subtropical study corroborate direct and indirect evidence obtained in tropical waters of multiple inshore habitat use by L. griseus, as well as its seasonal movement into or towards offshore reefs. For resource managers charged with designing and implementing management plans for subtropical coastal habitats and fisheries, our findings provide direct support for the strategy of conserving both inshore seagrass and mangrove habitats as well as offshore coral reefs.","[Luo, Jiangang; Serafy, Joseph E.; Sponaugle, Su; Teare, Paul B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Serafy, Joseph E.] NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kieckbusch, David] Milian Swain & Associates Inc, W Palm Beach, FL 33411 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Luo, JG (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",jluo@rsmas.miami.edu,,,,,,,44,110,124,0,63,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Monitoring post-translocation movements and migration provides useful information to inform translocation strategies. Three species of large-bodied fish (Yellowfin Bream Acanthopagrus australis, Luderick Girella tricuspidata, and Tarwhine Rhabdosargus sarba) impounded in a cooling water canal at a power station were translocated into the adjacent estuary (Lake Macquarie, New South Wales). Translocated fish were tagged with acoustic tags ( equipped with accelerometer sensors (providing a relative measure of fish activity) and released on either an artificial reef or a natural reef. In addition, 8 freeranging Yellowfin Bream were captured and tagged on the artificial reef. Fish were tracked throughout Lake Macquarie on a dispersed array of 18 VemcoVR2W receivers, and on the artificial reef using a VR4-UWM Vemco Positioning System, for up to 11 months. Yellowfin Bream and Luderick rapidly migrated back to the power station, whereas Tarwhine remained near the release location. Translocated Yellowfin Bream showed divergent behavioural patterns to free-ranging Yellowfin Bream on the artificial reef, with much higher activity levels, elevated nocturnal activity, and different patterns of habitat usage, possibly reflecting divergent foraging behaviour. This study presents a rare example of non-natal homing to an artificial habitat in several large-bodied marine fish species. The role of low frequency sound in the homing of translocated fish, and factors contributing to the observed behavioural patterns are discussed. The presence of a homing signal which can facilitate return migration may decrease the efficacy of translocation efforts for adult marine fishes; however, these responses are speciesspecific and will require evaluation on a case-by-case basis.","[Taylor, Matthew D.; Becker, Alistair; Lowry, Michael B.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Locked Bag 1, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.; Payne, Nicholas L.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Taylor, MD (corresponding author), Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Locked Bag 1, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia.;Taylor, MD (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",matt.taylor@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Payne, Nicholas/E-7811-2013","Becker, Alistair/0000-0001-5578-7208; Payne, Nicholas/0000-0002-5274-471X",Origin Energy; NSW Recreational Fishing Saltwater Trust,Origin Energy; NSW Recreational Fishing Saltwater Trust,"The authors wish to thank those that have assisted in the research conducted at Eraring Power Station since 2013, namely J.

Their spatial ecology is poorly understood, creating challenges for effective conservation of this enigmatic marine predator. Using acoustic telemetry and network analyses, we describe the movement patterns of 15 mature great hammerhead sharks (207-331.5 cm fork length) primarily within the waters of the southeastern United States from April 2019 to December 2022, including identifying movement corridors, core use areas and seasonal shifts in habitat use. Great hammerheads exhibited partial migration; some sharks undertook consistent, repeatable, round-trip migrations between the tagging site in the Florida Keys and northern points in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. Conversely, others remained in the Florida Keys year-round. Network analysis coupled with community detection algorithms revealed that individual great hammerheads displayed oceanic basin affinity, favouring migration to either the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. Great hammerheads that remained in the Florida Keys shifted their habitat use seasonally from inshore channels (spring and summer) to offshore artificial reefs and the natural reef tract (summer through winter). These shifts may be driven by prey availability, as core use areas often corresponded to known locations of seasonal spawning aggregations for reef fish.

The use of acoustic monitoring and network analysis can improve our understanding of the spatial ecology and functional connectivity of reef-associated species, providing a useful approach for reef-based conservation planning. This study compared and contrasted the movement and connectivity of sharks with different degrees of reef association. We examined the residency, dispersal, degree of reef connectivity, and MPA use of grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), silvertip (C. albimarginatus), and bull (C. leucas) sharks monitored in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus were detected most days at or near their tagging reef. However, while C. amblyrhynchos spent 80% of monitoring days in the array, C. albimarginatus was only detected 50% of the time. Despite both species moving similar distances (<50 km), a large portion of the population of C. albimarginatus (71%) was detected on multiple reefs and moved more frequently between reefs and management zones than C. amblyrhynchos. Carcharhinus leucas was detected less than 20% of the time within the tagging array, and 42% of the population undertook long-range migrations to other arrays in the GBR. Networks derived for C. leucas were larger and more complex than those for C. amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus. Our findings suggest that protecting specific reefs based on prior knowledge (e.g., healthier reefs with high fish biomass) and increasing the level of protection to include nearby, closely spaced reef habitats (<20 km) may perform better for species like C. albimarginatus than having either a single or a network of isolated MPAs. This design would also provide protection for larger male C. amblyrhynchos, which tend to disperse more and use larger areas than females. For wide-ranging sharks like C. leucas, a combination of spatial planning and other alternative measures is critical. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic monitoring can serve as a useful platform for designing more effective MPA networks for reef predators displaying a range of movement patterns.","[Espinoza, Mario; Ledee, Elodie J.

Acoustic monitoring studies indicate that olive rockfish are highly residential and that black rockfish are capable of long migrations and have less site fidelity; yet little is known about the long-term movements of blue rockfish. External tag-recapture studies indicate that blue rockfish may have intermediate movements relative to these congener nearshore species. To better understand the site fidelity, and daily and seasonal movements of blue rockfish over long (>1-year) time scales, we placed acoustic transmitters into 21 adult blue rockfish (30-41 cm total length) in Carmel Bay, California. Blue rockfish displayed intermediate movement patterns and residency relative to other similar kelp forest rockfish species. Two-thirds of tagged blue rockfish (13 fish) exhibited high residency to the study area (>12 mo). When in residence, mean home range of blue rockfish was 0.23 km(2), however as many as 30% of tagged blue rockfish shifted their core home range area during the study. Most shifts in home range occurred during upwelling season, and tagged fish moved up to 3.1 km when in residence. Blue rockfish with short residence times were last detected in the study area in late winter and early spring. Blue rockfish were observed at shallower depths during day than night, likely indicative of diurnal feeding. However, over longer time scales, blue rockfish were detected at deeper depths during upwelling periods and with increased wave heights. Daily and seasonal vertical movements of blue rockfish may be influenced by upwelling conditions and local prey abundance.","[Green, Kristen M.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Sitka, AK 99835 USA; [Greenley, Ashley P.] Fishwise, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Starr, Richard M.] Univ Calif, Sea Grant Extens Program, Moss Landing, CA USA",Alaska Department of Fish & Game,"Green, KM (corresponding author), Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Sitka, AK 99835 USA.",kristen.green@alaska.gov,,"Green, Kristen/0000-0001-8684-0884",California Sea Grant College Program,California Sea Grant College Program,"Funding for this study was provided by the California Sea Grant College Program (http://www-csgc.ucsd.edu/).

We used a 300 km long passive acoustic telemetry network to measure site fidelity and dispersal distances of adult red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) tagged within two estuarine no-take zones at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. Seventy-eight tagged fish were tracked an average of 549 days with some individuals followed for over four years. Fish spent most of their total time at liberty inside no-take zones with a mean residency of 125-178 consecutive days after release, and 67%-95% of their total time, depending on species. Sixty-four individuals (82%) also utilized adjacent public waters, dispersing up to 650 km, although dispersal rates averaged less than 0.10 km day(-1) for all three species. Red drum and black drum movements across reserve boundaries were clearly bi-directional with individuals averaging 4 and 30 excursions per year, respectively, into fished areas. Both species spent more time outside reserve boundaries during their reproductive periods, suggesting that these no-take zones protect individuals that subsequently spawn over a wider geographic area. Our findings demonstrate that coastal marine reserves have the potential to provide substantial protection for highly mobile non-reef fishes. They further suggest that reserves designed to safeguard fish during non-reproductive periods may be most practical for estuarine species whose home ranges increase during spawning seasons.

Temperature shifts can impact their reproductive cycle and behaviour, including acoustic signalling associated with courtship and mating in vocal fishes. Here, we examined the effect of temperature and other environmental factors on spawning-related chorusing behaviour in the meagre Argyrosomus regius. Using an automatic recognition system based on hidden Markov models coupled with one-third octave band sound level analysis, we extracted meagre daily vocal activity over 4 yr of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) in the Tagus estuary (Portugal). Meagre vocal activity showed a distinct diel pattern, with choruses being most prevalent at dusk. Chorus activity started earlier in years with warmer springs, while the end of the season was concurrent with the rise in water temperature. Circa 70% of daily variations were explained by changes in water temperature. Tidal cycle, lunar phase and changes in daylength did not appear to affect vocal behaviour. Choruses were detected on days with mean water temperature ranging from 15-25 degrees C, with stronger chorusing observed around 18 degrees C. Abrupt temperature changes caused disruption in choruses and likely in associated spawning. This study highlights the importance of temperature to fish reproduction and demonstrates that PAM can be a useful tool for long-term conservation management plans. PAM may also allow us to predict how temperature shifts due to climate change may affect fish reproduction, using vocal fishes as model species.","[Vieira, Manuel; Amorim, M.

Whereas the majority of seabass left the area in winter, 13 seabass stayed in the harbour experiencing temperatures as low as 2.8 & DEG;C. Two groups of seabass were identified having different core movement areas in the inner and outer harbours, although movement between the two areas was possible. The distinct differences in habitat use between these groups resulted in a significantly different level of exposure to fisheries under the same policy framework. By quantifying the level of protection of seabass, based on the spatiotemporal fisheries management in place, our study underlines the importance of taking into account movement behaviour when evaluating conservation measures.","[Goossens, Jolien; Moens, Tom] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Goossens, Jolien; Reubens, Jan] Flanders Marine Inst, Marine Observat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Villagra, Damian; Torreele, Els] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food, Anim Sci Unit, Marine Res Area, ILVO Marine Res, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [De Putter, Georges] Sights Nat, B-8490 Jabbeke, Belgium; [Verhelst, Pieterjan] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Aquat Management, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Flanders Marine Institute VLIZ; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Research Institute for Nature & Forest,"Goossens, J (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Goossens, J (corresponding author), Flanders Marine Inst, Marine Observat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Jolien.Goossens@UGent.be,"Moens, Tom/AAB-8701-2019; Reubens, Jan/MIN-6043-2025; Verhelst, Pieterjan/I-4864-2019","Verhelst, Pieterjan/0000-0002-2610-6941; Goossens, Jolien/0000-0002-0853-9153",,,,,62,3,3,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

However, fine-scale movements and use of artificial reefs by red snapper over diel periods is unclear. Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550-745 mm TL; n = 12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100 m, with 75% of locations within 30 m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean = 27.5 m, SD = 7.1) than day (mean = 19.1 m, SD = 8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332-958d based on passive acoustic monitoring. The close proximity of these fish to the reef over 24-h periods and the long-term residency provides evidence that these artificial reefs are important habitat for red snapper and should be considered an effective management tool.

This is particularly the case when testing for the effects of barotrauma, where the incision for an internal tag would inadvertently vent the fish, precluding an unvented or control treatment. The rise of barotrauma experimentation has increased the need for methods facilitating this design. Here, we develop and test a novel technique to externally attach acoustic tags, without causing the release of gasses from the fish's body cavity. In addition, this method does not require anesthetics, thereby allowing researchers to eliminate artifacts associated with sedation when trying to more accurately replicate real-world fishery conditions. We used accelerometer/depth tags to provide information on how long an externally tagged fish would retain its tag in situ. Changes in acceleration or changes in depth were used as a proxy to determine whether the fish was alive or dead or had shed its tag. Results showed that 80% of the fish (n = 20) detected retained their tags for at least 48 h. Seventy-five percent of the fish tagged retained their tags for at least 23 d. After 23 d, tags were shed periodically until day 49. Thirty-three percent of fish tagged retained their tags until day 57, when the experiment was ended. The ability of these modified tags to stay attached for at least 23 d suggests that the technique would be successful for maintaining a balanced experimental design for measuring postrelease mortality or changes in behavior in deepwater fishes while eliminating artifacts typically associated with internal tag implantation.","[Johnson, Matthew W.; Stunz, Gregory W.] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Diamond, Sandra L.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Diamond, Sandra L.] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University Corpus Christi; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Western Sydney University,"Stunz, GW (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",greg.stunz@tamucc.edu,"Johnson, Matthew/AAA-3299-2020",,Texas A&M-Corpus Christi Research Enhancement Grant Program,Texas A&M-Corpus Christi Research Enhancement Grant Program,"We thank A.

Four commercial fish species (Epinephelus maculatus, Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus microrhinos, and Scarus ghobban) were studied for 17 months (45 fish). Nine fish (20%) were detected on reefs other than the reef onto which they were released. Four patterns of inter-reef movement were identified during the survey, including home range relocations, movements larger than the scale of the study, many inter-reef movements within the study area, and punctual excursions outside the daily home range. The information gathered in this study demonstrates the ability of the fish to carry out medium-scale movements in a fragmented habitat. Consequently, the effectiveness of the reserve to protect the entire population is probably limited for these species. Because all the identified patterns implied at least one movement across the reserve boundaries, our results support the hypothesis that the Laregnere Marine Reserve, part of the South Lagoon Marine Park, could benefit the adjacent fished area through spillover.","[Chateau, Olivier; Wantiez, Laurent] LIVE Univ New Caledonia, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia",,"Wantiez, L (corresponding author), LIVE Univ New Caledonia, BP R4, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia.",wantiez@univ-nc.nc,"Wantiez, Laurent/L-3343-2013","Wantiez, Laurent/0000-0001-5024-2057",,,,,32,56,68,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

We performed an acoustic tagging study implemented within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Australia, to assess the movement patterns, home range and diel activity of snapper (Chrysophrys auratus; Sparidae); a species of significant recreational and commercial fishing importance in Australia. The study focused on C. auratus movements around Cabbage Tree Island, which is predominantly a no-take sanctuary zone (no fishing), with an array of acoustic stations deployed around the island and adjacent reefs and islands. Thirty C. auratus were tagged with internal acoustic tags in November 2010 with their movements recorded until September 2014. Both adult and juvenile C. auratus were observed to display strong site fidelity to Cabbage Tree Island with a mean 12-month residency index of 0.83 (range = 0 low to 1 high). Only three fish were detected on acoustic receivers away from Cabbage Tree Island, with one fish moving a considerable distance of similar to 290 kms over a short time frame (46 days). The longest period of residency recorded at the island was for three fish occurring regularly at the site for a period of 1249 days. Chrysophrys auratus displayed strong diurnal behaviour and detection frequency was significantly higher during the day than at night; however, there was no significant difference in detection frequency between different hours. This study demonstrates that even small-scale protected areas can benefit C. auratus during multiple life-history stages as it maintains a small home range and displays strong site fidelity over a period of 3 years.","[Harasti, David; Gallen, Christopher] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia; [Lee, Kate A.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Hughes, Julian M.; Stewart, John] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Macquarie University; Sydney Institute of Marine Science; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Harasti, D (corresponding author), NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia.",david.harasti@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Stewart, John/N-7330-2016; Harasti, David/I-1266-2019; Hughes, Julian/D-2695-2017","Hughes, Julian/0000-0002-0884-8386",NSW Recreational Fishing Trust [DPI60],NSW Recreational Fishing Trust,"This study was supported by NSW Recreational Fishing Trust (Project DPI60) (to JS).

Acoustic tagging and tracking of 84 Lethrinus nebulosus in the Ningaloo Marine Park indicated that sizes of individual habitat utilisation kernels were similar across diel and tidal cycles, but varied greatly among individuals. Clearly differentiated diel and tidal habitat use patterns were evident in significant proportions of individuals, particularly in relation to tidal phase. For the majority of residents, home-range sizes were reasonably stable over periods of 2-4 years, but in some cases core areas did shift over time. At seasonal time scales, peaks of seasonal activity and home range area were recorded during spawning season (October-December). Long-distance return migrations to spawning locations were observed that were among the longest observed for any reef fish (over 130km). Suspected spawning-related movements were recorded almost exclusively in fish >500-mm fork length, and were semilunar, following quarter moons in October-December. Significant individual-level variability in movement and habitat use patterns, evident across multiple temporal scales, has important implications for the management of L. nebulosus populations.","[Babcock, R.

To better understand spatial and temporal movement patterns and help determine the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve (Buck Island Reef National Monument, BIRNM), 55 queen triggerfish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked for 434.6 +/- 27.3 d (mean SE) within a large acoustic array in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Queen triggerfish displayed high site fidelity within the reserve during non-spawning months. Home range sizes, as measured by 95 % minimum convex polygons and kernel utilization distributions, averaged 2.44 t 0.30 and 3.34 +/- 0.17 km(2), respectively. High site fidelity was interrupted briefly during full moons from November to March (2015-2017), when 22 % of the tagged population (n = 12) undertook repeated migrations to a nesting area located approximately 12 km from BIRNM. During the same-season spawning periods, 5 other fish were exclusively detected at a receiver station within the reserve, indicating a possible local nesting area and resident (non-migratory) contingent of queen triggerfish. The high site fidelity of queen triggerfish during non-spawning months coupled with the discovery of a resident spawning population highlights the importance of BIRNM as a potential refuge from local fishing pressures. This study provides improved understanding of queen triggerfish movement ecology, an extremely valuable asset for the development of spatial management strategies throughout their range.","[Bryan, David R.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Bryan, David R.] Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Feeley, Michael W.] Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Inventory & Monitoring Ne, 18001 Old Cutler Rd Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Pollock, Clayton] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Natl Pk, 2100 Church St 100, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA",University of Miami; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; University of the Virgin Islands; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Bryan, DR (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Bryan, DR (corresponding author), Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",david.bryan@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007; Bryan, David/0000-0002-3846-1553",NPS [PMIS 141633]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (MARFIN) [NA13NMF4330167]; Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (National Science Foundation) [1355437]; Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1355437] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NPS; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (MARFIN)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (National Science Foundation); Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"National Park Service (NPS) staff Tessa Code and Jeff Gay were a tremendous help with in situ tagging operations and led the colossal task of downloading and maintaining the acoustic array.

Here, we used passive acoustic telemetry to examine the effects of a jetty and artificial light on the rates of predation of flatback turtle (Natator depressus) hatchlings as they disperse through nearshore waters. When released near a jetty, around 70% of the tagged hatchlings were predated before they could transit the nearshore, irrespective of the presence or absence of artificial light. Only 3 to 23% of hatchlings encountered predators at a second study site nearby where there was no jetty and a similar amount of nesting activity. Evidence for predation was provided by rapid tag detachment due to prey handling by a predator or the extensive movement of the tags within the receiver array suggesting that the tag (and hatchling) was inside the stomach of a predator. We found that 70% of the fish predators that consumed tags used the jetty as a refuge during the day and expanded their range along nearshore waters at night, predating on hatchlings in areas adjacent to the jetty with the highest nesting density. Sampling of potential predators including lutjanid reef fishes under the jetty revealed the presence of turtle hatchlings in their gut contents. By providing daytime refuges for predators, nearshore structures such as jetties have the potential to concentrate predators and they may pose a significant threat to populations of vulnerable species. Such effects must be taken into consideration when assessing the environmental impacts associated with these structures.","[Wilson, Phillipa; Pattiaratchi, Charitha] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Wilson, Phillipa; Pattiaratchi, Charitha] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Wilson, Phillipa; Thums, Michele; Ferreira, Luciana C.; Meekan, Mark] Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, Australian Inst Marine Sci, M096,35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Whiting, Scott] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Marine Sci Program, 17 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia; [Pendoley, Kellie] Pendoley Environm, 12A Pitt Way, Booragoon, WA 6154, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; Australian Institute of Marine Science; University of Western Australia,"Wilson, P (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.;Wilson, P (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",phillipa.wilson@research.uwa.edu.au; m.thums@aims.gov.au; chari.pattiaratchi@uwa.edu.au; scott.whiting@dbca.wa.gov.au; kellie.pendoley@penv.com.au; l.ferreira@aims.gov.au; m.meekan@aims.gov.au,"; Thums, Michele/A-3850-2013; Pattiaratchi, Charitha/E-6916-2011","Cerqueira Ferreira, Luciana/0000-0001-6755-2799; Thums, Michele/0000-0002-8669-8440; Meekan, Mark/0000-0002-3067-9427; Whiting, Scott/0000-0003-3339-9559; Pattiaratchi, Charitha/0000-0003-2229-6183; Pendoley, Kellie/0000-0002-1365-4607","University of Western Australia; Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions","University of Western Australia; Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions","P.W. was supported by a University Postgraduate Award Scholarship from the University of Western Australia.

Wax-coated dummy transmitters (9 X 22 mm; 3.6 g) were surgically implanted into the gut cavity of four captive bluefin trevally. The fish retained the dummy transmitters for 17-22 months, but at the end of the study transintestinal expulsion was in progress in one individual. Five bluefin trevally captured at Honokohau, Hawaii, were surgically implanted with long-life (1-year) coded transmitters and released. Their movements were monitored with the use of 27 underwater receivers deployed along a 115-km stretch of coastline. The five bluefin trevally were detected by the receivers over periods ranging from I to 173 d (mean, 60 d), and their movements spanned up to 10.2 km of coastline. Daily movements were consistent with those observed by previous short-term active tracking studies and consisted of crepuscular migrations of 1-2 km between separate daytime and nighttime habitats. These data suggest that passive monitoring of bluefin trevally movements for periods of up to 22 months is theoretically possible and that transmitter expulsion is not necessarily the cause of shorter detection periods.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Hawaii Dept Land & Nat Resources, Div Aquat Resources, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,14,30,34,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

In the Caribbean, populations of Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus have declined due to fishing impacts on spawning aggregations. Despite local and regional efforts by fisheries managers to implement regulations protecting spawning aggregations, few Nassau grouper populations appear to be recovering. In order to improve management strategies for this critically endangered species, it is necessary to understand the spatial ecology of the species across seasons and years. In the Cayman Islands, we used a multi-year, presence/absence, depth-coded acoustic tagging dataset of Nassau grouper to characterize patterns in the species' behavior and vertical habitat use at home reef sites. Twenty acoustically tagged individuals (56-84 cm, 70.01 +/- 7.40 cm; total length, mean +/- SD) maintained consistent home reef sites, although some fish regularly shifted activity centers within the home site, often following a seasonal spawning migration. Seven fish with depth-coded tags showed a higher probability of vertical movement in the hours immediately following dawn and preceding dusk. We found evidence of a positive relationship between the fish condition factor and depth of home reef site. The finding of persistent home reef sites across years suggests that properly sized spatial reserves at home reef sites can be a useful complement to spawning aggregation protection when considering management strategies for Nassau grouper.","[Blincow, Kayla M.; Stevens-McGeever, Sierra J.; Semmens, Brice X.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bush, Phillippe G.; McCoy, Croy M.; Johnson, Bradley C.] Cayman Isl Govt, Dept Environm, KY1-1002, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands; [Heppell, Scott A.; Heppell, Selina S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Pattengill-Semmens, Christy, V; Whaylen, Leslie] Reel Environm Educ Fdn REEF, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA; [Whaylen, Leslie] NOAA, Flower Garden Banks Natl Marine Sanctuary, Galveston, TX 77551 USA; [Luke, Kirsten] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Atlantic Coast Joint Venture, Panama City, FL 32405 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Oregon State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Semmens, BX (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",bsemmens@ucsd.edu,,"Blincow, Kayla/0000-0003-3944-5317",Lenfest Ocean Program; Disney Conservation Fund; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration International Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA04NOS4630287]; P.

Many of these animals, however, are impossible to observe directly, making it necessary to use indirect methods of observation such as biotelemetry in order to study them. Despite technological advances with tracking equipment enabling movement to be assessed in 3 dimensions, many studies restrict their analyses to traditional 2-dimensional (2D) space use. We compared 2D and 3D (1) core and home range size, (2) home range overlap and (3) changes in space use in relation to biological and environmental variables of a large, demersal reef-dwelling fish species, the eastern blue groper Achoerodus viridis, tracked using passive acoustic telemetry. Mixed effects models were used to determine differences between the core/home range sizes and home range overlap between the sex of the fish and the breeding and non-breeding seasons. The 2D analyses were unable to detect differences in core and home range sizes between the sexes that were successfully identified by the 3D analyses. 2D analyses only detected differences in home range overlap between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, whereas the 3D analyses found seasonal differences according to the sex of the fish. Two-hourly 2D space use estimates failed to detect differences in space use between fished and protected areas that were detected in the 3D analyses. This study demonstrates that to truly understand how animals use the space they inhabit, we must assess their movement in the full spatial context of their environment.","[Lee, K. A.; Harcourt, R.

Short-term movements of fish were determined by acoustic telemetry and long-term movements and growth were investigated with conventional tag and release methods. Giant trevally appear to move to the Coconut Island marine reserve from the adjacent bay floor upon attaining a size of approximately 20-25 cm fork length. After several years spent frequenting the reserve, giant trevally move out of the bay into deeper water. Tracked fish spent considerable time within the marine reserve moving along the reef slope, but frequently ventured Outside of the reserve boundaries. The recapture rate for tagged fish was 11%, with an average time at liberty of 346 days. Nearly one-third of recaptured fish were caught at distances greater than 3 kin from the tagging site with maximum values demonstrating long-term (more than 7 years) and long-distance (30 kin) movements. The protective function of the Coconut Island marine reserve for giant trevally is limited because the reserve is utilized by only a portion of the population, and even these fish regularly move outside of the refuge.

To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5 +/- 0.5 km(2) compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km(2). Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending similar to 80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km(2) array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements. This study indicates that despite exhibiting stable and small home ranges over periods of one to two years, more than half the population of spangled emperor move at scales greater than average sanctuary size within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park.","[Pillans, Richard D.; Babcock, Russel C.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Downie, Ryan; Patterson, Toby A.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Bearham, Douglas; Thomson, Damian P.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Perth, WA, Australia; [Boomer, Andrew] SIMS, IMOS Anim Tagging & Monitoring, Mosman, NSW, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Pillans, RD (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Richard.Pillans@csiro.au,"Bearham, Doug/G-8689-2011; Pillans, Richard/F-2458-2012; Thomson, Damian/C-3047-2014; Patterson, Toby/B-3836-2011; Babcock, Russell C/A-3794-2012","Pillans, Richard/0000-0001-6234-8764; Thomson, Damian/0000-0001-5485-1562; Babcock, Russell C/0000-0002-7756-1290; Patterson, Toby/0000-0002-7150-9205; Bearham, Douglas/0000-0002-2977-2843",Ocean Flagship of CSIRO; Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI); CSIRO; Australian Animal Tracking and Monitoring System (AATAMS); facility of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS),Ocean Flagship of CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Australian Animal Tracking and Monitoring System (AATAMS); facility of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS),"This study was funded by the Wealth from Ocean Flagship of CSIRO and the Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI).

However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i.e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics.","[Koeck, Barbara; Caro, Anthony; Neveu, Reda; Crec'hriou, Romain; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Koeck, Barbara; Caro, Anthony; Neveu, Reda; Crec'hriou, Romain; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, Perpignan, France; [Alos, Josep] Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Esporles, Illes Balears, Spain",Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Koeck, B (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, Via Domitia, F-66025 Perpignan, France.",barbara.koeck@univ-perp.fr,"Koeck, Barbara/D-5174-2013; Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009","Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539; Koeck, Barbara/0000-0001-7142-364X",French ministry of higher education and research; regional council of Languedoc-Roussillon (France),French ministry of higher education and research; regional council of Languedoc-Roussillon (France)(Region Occitanie),"This work was in partial fulfillment of the doctoral thesis of Barbara Koeck at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE, Paris), who was supported by a grant from the French ministry of higher education and research.

From 1984 to 2016, a total of 3 430 C. nasutus (178-980 mm fork length) were tagged (with small plastic dart tags) throughout the species' distributional range, with an overall reported recapture rate of 7.2%. Recaptured individuals displayed high levels of residency, moving an average of 14.8 km, with time-at-liberty ranging from 0 to 6 809 days. The majority of recaptures (84.6%) were made within 1 km of the tagging sites; however, some large-scale movements, of up to 528 km, were recorded. Although C. nasutus individuals moving greater distances were characterised by greater mean sizes (mm fork length) at time of recapture, the distances moved by juveniles were not significantly different from those of adults (p > 0.05). Low levels of connectivity among coastal regions were therefore expected due to the high degree of residency displayed by this species. Combining traditional management approaches together with a well-designed network of no-take marine protected areas is likely to be the most effective way to protect this vulnerable species. A lack of data on the movements of adults remains a challenge, but this could be overcome by tracking large individuals tagged with long-life acoustic transmitters.","[Murray, T. S.; Cowley, P.

The sonar operated at frequencies between 1.8 and 3.6 kHz and consisted of a co-located source and horizontal line array deployed at 4 km from the reef. The experiment was conducted in a well-mixed shallow water waveguide which is conducive to characterizing fish aggregations at these distances. Large aggregations of fish were repeatedly seen to emerge rapidly from the shipwreck at dusk, disperse into the surrounding area during the night, and quickly converge back to the shipwreck at dawn. This is a rare, macroscopic observation of an ecologically-important reef fish behavior, delivered at the level of aggregations, instead of individual fish tracks that have been documented previously. The significance of this observation on sonar performance associated with target detection in the presence of fish clutter is discussed based on analyses of echo intensity and statistics. Building on previous studies of long-range fish echoes, this study further substantiates the unique utility of such sonar systems as an ecosystem monitoring tool, and illustrates the importance of considering the impact of the presence of fish on sonar applications.

Ambient noise levels were highest during the new moon and the lowest during the full moon. Ambient noise levels were also significantly higher during summer and lower during winter. Bandpass filtering (700-2,000 Hz and 2-15 kHz), combined with snap counts and data from other studies show that the majority of the sound intensity increases could be attributed to two organisms: the sea urchin and the snapping shrimp. The increased intensity of biologically produced sound during dusk, new moon and summer could enhance the biological signature of a reef and transmit it further offshore. Ambient noise generated from the coast, especially reefs, has been implicated as playing a role in guiding pelagic post-larval fish and crustaceans to settlement habitats. Determining a causal link between temporal increases in ambient noise and higher rates of settlement of reef fish and crustaceans would provide support for the importance of ambient underwater sound in guiding the settlement of these organisms.","[Radford, Craig A.; Jeffs, Andrew G.; Montgomery, John C.] Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth, New Zealand; [Tindle, Chris T.] Univ Auckland, Dept Phys, Auckland 1, New Zealand",University of Auckland; University of Auckland,"Radford, CA (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, POB 349, Warkworth, New Zealand.",c.radford@auckland.ac.nz,"Jeffs, Andrew/D-9474-2012; Montgomery, John/D-4310-2009","Radford, Craig/0000-0001-7949-9497; Montgomery, John/0000-0002-7451-3541; Jeffs, Andrew/0000-0002-8504-1949",,,,,71,148,169,4,45,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,JUL,2008,156,4,,,,,921,929,,10.1007/s00442-008-1041-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1041-y,,,9,Ecology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,323RH,18461369,,,,2025-05-02,WOS:000257465200019,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study examined spatial and dietary overlap between two co-occurring reef fish, namely Plectropomus leopardus and P. maculatus, at an inshore reef in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park using acoustic telemetry and stable isotopes. Movements of tagged fish within an acoustic array of 19 receivers deployed along a narrow reef portion of Orpheus Island were monitored for up to 3 years. Although space use was similar between species, spatial overlap was rare and P. maculatus (n = 30) was consistently deeper than P. leopardus (n = 32). Dietary overlap between species was high based on overlapping delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic niches in muscle tissue (n = 20). The complementary stable isotope and acoustic telemetry data revealed these species had similar isotopic niches but distinct space use patterns, which may be a product of competition for resources. These findings show species-specific behaviours within a genus commonly managed or reported as a single entity, and provide new information on partitioning of resources by Plectropomus spp. in inshore reef environments.","[Matley, J.

Over a six month period, we captured 38 wild adult great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), a species commonly associated with ciguatera in The Bahamas. We sampled three tissues (i.e., muscle, liver, and blood) and analysed them for the presence of ciguatoxins using a functional in vitro N2A bioassay. Detectable concentrations of ciguatoxins found in the three tissue types ranged from 2.51 to 211.74 pg C-CTX-1 equivalents/g. Blood and liver toxin concentrations were positively correlated (rho = 0.86, P = 0.003), indicating that, for the first time, blood sampling provides a non-lethal method of detecting ciguatoxin in wild fish. Non-lethal blood sampling also presents opportunities to couple this approach with biotelemetry and biologging techniques that enable the study of fish distribution and movement. To demonstrate the potential for linking ciguatoxin occurrence with barracuda spatial ecology, we also present a proof-of-concept case study where blood samples were obtained from 20 fish before releasing them with acoustic transmitters and tracking them in the coastal waters using a fixed acoustic telemetry array covering 44 km(2). Fish that tested positive for CTX may have smaller home ranges than non-toxic fish (median distance travelled, U = 2.21, P = 0.03). Results presented from this study may help identify high risk areas and source-sink dynamics of toxins, potentially reducing the incidence and human health risk of ciguatera fish poisoning. Moreover, development of the non-lethal sampling approach and measurement of ciguatera from blood provide future opportunities to understand the mechanistic relationship between toxins and the spatial ecology of a broad range of marine fish species.

This study tested the effect of release density on emigration, activity patterns, and space utilization by releasing juvenile mulloway (Sciaenidae: Argyrosomus japonicus) at low and high densities and monitoring movement intensively for 336h post release. Mulloway released at high densities had faster emigration and greater overall emigration rates than low density releases. Also, mulloway released at high densities used sub-optimal habitats at a greater frequency. Released fish dispersed into habitat patches at densities proportional to the quality of the habitat patch, consistent with density-dependent habitat selection. Targeting releases of small numbers of fish to the carrying capacity of individual patches of habitat will contribute to the success and economic viability of release programs in open systems. Releases of high densities of individuals or repeated releases at the same site may lead to increased emigration and losses from the stocked system. The capacity of a target habitat to support released fish can be rapidly assessed using pilot releases and intensive monitoring of acoustically tagged fish, prior to the implementation of large-scale release programs.","[Taylor, Matthew D.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.; Fairfax, Andrew V.; Suthers, Iain M.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Fairfax, Andrew V.; Suthers, Iain M.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; University of New South Wales Sydney; Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Taylor, MD (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",matt.taylor@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Suthers, Iain/C-4559-2008","Suthers, Iain/0000-0002-9340-7461",Recreational Fishing Trust [L40],Recreational Fishing Trust,"The authors would like to thank the following in their help in the field: T.

To support community-based management of an artisanal fishery that targets bonefish (Albula glossodonta) spawning aggregations, we used a combination of acoustic telemetry, biological sampling, and remote imagery to reveal the spatiotemporal spawning migrations of bonefish on Anaa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia. The spawning migrations of bonefish tracked with acoustic telemetry were restricted to the northern section of the atoll, with 99.6% of all detections at offshore spawning habitats occurring on fixed acoustic receivers adjacent to the atoll's artisanal fish trap complex. Male bonefish undertook spawning migrations more frequently than females and these spawning migrations were common during the Austral winter and fall. The movements of bonefish spawning aggregations coincided with the lunar cycle, as a network analysis revealed an increase in network size and the diversity of habitat use within our acoustic array throughout the duration of the waning moon. Our results highlighted the need for the management of the artisanal trap fishery to prevent the overharvest of bonefish during their peak spawning periods.

We also assessed the efficacy of a small sanctuary zone to reduce anthropogenic pressures. Tagged southern eagle rays in Coffin Bay were semi-permanent residents (residency index similar to 0.35), with a seasonal exodus from late autumn to spring, high residency from mid-spring to mid-autumn, and selection of Kellidie Bay (located within Coffin Bay). Most (67%) rays were detected in the Kellidie Bay Sanctuary Zone, but spent <15% of their time in Coffin Bay within the sanctuary. Individual variation in the amount of time spent in the Kellidie Bay Sanctuary Zone was high, ranging 0-42%. In contrast, tagged southern eagle rays along the Fleurieu Peninsula had high site fidelity throughout the year (residency index similar to 85%). Our study provides new information on space use and movement patterns of southern eagle rays, highlighting that intraspecific variation should be accounted for in future management considerations.","[Davey, Joshua; Clarke, Thomas M.; Niella, Yuri; Dennis, Joshua D.; Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Southern Shark Ecol Grp, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia; [Niella, Yuri] Macquarie Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Flinders University South Australia; Macquarie University,"Davey, J (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Southern Shark Ecol Grp, Adelaide, SA 5042, Australia.",joshua.davey@flinders.edu.au,"Dennis, Josh/KBC-0895-2024","Huveneers, Charlie/0000-0001-8937-1358; Dennis, Joshua Donovan/0000-0002-7442-6667",Flinders University College of Science and Engineering,Flinders University College of Science and Engineering,Funding provided by the Flinders University College of Science and Engineering.

We used manual acoustic telemetry coupled with global positioning technology to track the detailed spatially explicit daily movements (24 h) of multiple individuals of two common Caribbean fish species, Haemulon sciurus (bluestriped grunt) and Lutjanus apodus (schoolmaster snapper). Movement pathways and day and night activity spaces were mapped and quantified in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Directional sun-synchronous migrations occurred close to astronomical sunset and sunrise. Site fidelity within day and night activity spaces was high. Nine of twelve individuals exhibited overlap of day and night activity spaces and three fish (L. apodus) exhibited complete spatial segregation. Night activity spaces (H. sciurus: 11,309 +/- 3,548 m(2); L. apodus: 9,950 +/- 3,120 m(2)) were significantly larger than day activity spaces (H. sciurus: 2,778 +/- 1,979 m(2); L. apodus: 1,291 +/- 636 m(2)). The distance between sequential position fixes (step lengths) was significantly greater at night than day, indicative of nocturnal foraging and day resting behavior. Integrating acoustic telemetry, GIS techniques and spatial statistics to study fish movement behavior revealed both individual variability and some broader generality in movement paths and activity spaces suggestive of complex underlying behavioral mechanisms influencing diel movements.","[Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] NOAA NOS NCCOS CCMA, Biogeog Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Brown, Kerry A.] Kingston Univ London, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 1LQ, Surrey, England",University of the Virgin Islands; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Kingston University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Brown, Kerry/U-5082-2019","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970; BROWN, KERRY/0000-0002-6342-8966",NOAA; University of the Virgin Islands,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of the Virgin Islands,"This research was supported by a NOAA cooperative agreement with the University of the Virgin Islands.

Results from both methods showed that this species is likely to be a temporary resident on shallow inshore reefs; fish showed high site fidelity and occupied relatively small home ranges for periods seldom exceeding 12 months, whereafter they appeared to undertake ranging-type movements. Adults >400 mm total length were more mobile than juveniles, and the distance moved increased with both fish size and time at liberty. Adults south of Durban, South Africa, moved farther in a northerly direction than those north of Durban, confirming that spawning likely takes place north of Durban. No direct evidence of a spawning migration was found, but anecdotal reports that they form spawning aggregations suggests that migrations for this purpose are likely to occur. The current species-specific linefish regulations and the recently expanded marine protected area network along the east coast of South Africa are believed to be adequate to ensure the future sustainable use of this species. However, improved enforcement of regulations is required, and identification of spawning aggregation sites should be a research priority.","[Mann, B. Q.; Daly, R.; Jordaan, G. L.; Dalton, W.

Defining ecological roles is challenging in complex ecosystems such as coral reefs. While it is well known that multiple reef-associated shark species coexist on a single reef, their patterns of space use and interactions have been difficult to define. Here we used acoustic telemetry data to analyse activity space, depth use and spatial networks to examine the interplay of these species relative to their roles in coral reef ecosystems. Integration of multiple analyses revealed that species with similar sizes and similar diets displayed clear spatial segregation, both between habitats and depth. This distribution is likely to reduce competition for prey among these species. In contrast, species that are dietary generalists or that have unique diets moved more broadly and overlapped with all other species. These results suggest competition for prey may be a driving factor in the distribution and space use of reef-associated sharks, revealing complex, interdependent functional roles within these systems. Results of this analysis demonstrate the advanced information that can be obtained through application of multiple methods and directed, simultaneous study of multiple species.","[Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.; Ledee, Elodie J.

However, we lack empirical studies demonstrating the validity of key assumptions underpinning this concept, including that herbivorous fishes (1) are permanently resident within MR boundaries, (2) routinely consume the invasive algae of concern at significant levels and (3) are not significant mobile vectors for propagules of the invasive algae. A 46-year-old MR (Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge, 21 degrees 27'35 '' N, 157 degrees 48'15 '' W) in waters off Oahu provided a natural setting to examine these factors with the herbivorous bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis) and the invasive rhodophyte, Gracilaria salicornia. We acoustically tracked five unicornfish to quantify their residency and habitat use within the MR, conducted field and laboratory observations to confirm N. unicornis consume G. salicornia, and tested the viability of G. salicornia fragments recovered from unicornfish feces. Unicornfish were resident within the MR where they spent most time in reef crest habitat with occasional, brief forays into reef flat habitat. We confirmed unicornfish consume G. salicornia and found a significant positive correlation between algal canopy height and distance from the reef crest, presumably because grazing intensity is lower in less frequently utilized reef flat habitat. We demonstrated that unicornfish egest viable fragments of G. salicornia that resume vegetative growth after several weeks. We conclude that N. unicornis may act as both a natural control agent and a mobile vector for invasive alien algae.","[Bierwagen, Stacy L.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Price, Donald K.; Pack, Adam A.] Univ Hawaii, Trop Conservat Biol & Environm Sci Grad Program, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Pack, Adam A.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Psychol, Hilo, HI 96720 USA; [Meyer, Carl G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA",James Cook University; University of Hawaii System; University Hawaii Hilo; University of Hawaii System; University Hawaii Hilo; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Bierwagen, SL (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",stacy.bierwagen@my.jcu.edu.au,"Price, Donald/F-7722-2011","Price, Donald/0000-0003-2501-8373; Bierwagen, Stacy L./0000-0002-5345-4466",SeaGrant award [UNIHI-SEAGRANT-20101809],SeaGrant award,This study was funded by a SeaGrant award (#UNIHI-SEAGRANT-20101809) to CGM.,,48,8,9,0,37,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

A large number of empirical studies have focused on their effects on reef fish populations. Yet, few studies have looked at their effectiveness on semelparous species such as cephalopods, in spite of their commercial importance in many coastal regions across the globe. In this study we combine behavioural (biotelemetry) and demographic (experimental fishing) data to understand the effects of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) on local populations of cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. We used a beyond-BACI design to analyze the possible effect of the implementation of a no-take area on the abundance and biomass of this species and acoustic telemetry data to assess its site fidelity and movements within the study area. Results indicate that there was no detectable effect of the implementation of the no-take area on the abundance or biomass of cuttlefish. We found evidence that acoustically tagged adult cuttlefish leave the reserve a few days or weeks after tagging. The fact that cuttlefish have low site fidelity inside the reserve and large movements across and beyond the study area explains why there is no increase in the population inside the MPA. These results suggest that small coastal marine reserves such as the LSMP are not effective in providing long term protection to cuttlefish populations and, probably, those of other short-lived, highly mobile cephalopods.

Despite their increased use in recent years, the choice of structures used at artificial reefs remains largely haphazard due to the lack of information on reef structure performance. Few studies have examined the use of different artificial reef structures by individual fish. From 2021-2022, we acoustically tagged 72 black sea bass (Centropristis striata), 34 gag (Mycteroperca mircrolepis), 27 greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), nine almaco jack (S. rivoliana), and eight red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) on four artificial reef complexes near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, U.S. Available artificial reef structures consisted of materials of various sizes and heights made of concrete and metal. We tracked tagged fish using a fine-scale positioning system for similar to 100 days. Black sea bass exhibited high site fidelity to the artificial structure where we caught them, rarely moving away from that structure. The limited movement resulted in low transition probabilities; we conclude that black sea bass do not select for particular artificial structures. Gag and red snapper moved greater distances away from artificial structures and routinely moved between them. Greater amberjack and almaco jack moved the most within the complexes displaying circling behavior around individual structures and were the only species that regularly moved off the artificial reef complexes. Greater amberjack movements away from artificial sites were most commonly directed to surrounding shipwrecks. Whereas gag, red snapper, almaco jack, and greater amberjack used all available structures, they consistently selected for high relief structures, such as vessels, more than other structures. These results will be useful to managers charged with decisions on what types of structures to place at artificial reef complexes to supplement or enhance habitat for economically important fishes.","[Tharp, Ryan M.; Buckel, Jeffrey A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Morehead City, NC 27695 USA; [Hostetter, Nathan J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, North Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Raleigh, NC USA; [Paxton, Avery B.; Taylor, J.

However, it has been poorly studied and little is known about its spatial ecology, particularly about long-range travels. In this study, we investigated the residency and movement patterns of silvertip sharks in a widespread remote archipelago offshore the Pacific coast of Mexico, the Revillagigedo Archipelago. An array of 10 VR2W receivers was deployed around the archipelago to monitor the movement of 45 silvertip sharks during 11 years. Among the 40 sharks detected during the study, 34 exhibited high site fidelity with 70% of their daily detections recorded in one particular site. Residency index ranged from 0.049 to 0.99 with an average residency of 0.49 +/- 0.27 (SD). The sharks exhibited strong diurnal patterns in horizontal and vertical movements with two peaks of detections at sunrise and sunset and a presence in deeper waters during daytime. Eleven individuals (7 adult females) traveled from one island to another (separated by distances ranging from 60 to 425 km). Geographical ontogenetic segregation was observed within the archipelago with juveniles being present only around San Benedicto and Socorro islands. Five sharks tagged as juveniles left their tagging island once they had reached adulthood, three males between 8 and 10 years old and two females at 11 years old.","[Beauvais, Sarah M.

Known for forming large spawning aggregations, numbering tens of thousands, they are now listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Recently, the only Nassau grouper spawning aggregation in Puerto Rico was documented at Bajo de Sico, a seamount and seasonally closed marine protected area.Studies elsewhere on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Nassau grouper aggregations have documented how, and how far, fish move from home sites to the spawning site, and have shown the tight link between aggregation formation and the lunar cycle. However, these studies have not evaluated the potential impacts of the reduced spatial extent represented by a seamount, nor have they addressed the impacts of local seasonal protection relative to the size of the closed area and the timing of aggregation formation.Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of Nassau grouper spawning aggregation formation at Bajo de Sico. Twenty-six individuals were tagged and tracked over three consecutive spawning seasons.Nassau grouper formed three or four aggregations per season, corresponding to the lunar cycles from January to April. Individuals displayed high visitation rates to the aggregation site: 98% visited at least two peaks per season; 80% visited multiple seasons. The timing of arrival, departure, and residency at the site were significantly different among individuals and lunar months, indicating significant variability in aggregation formation. Nassau grouper occupied a relatively small staging area (2.7 km(2)) and courtship arena (0.67 km(2)) compared with aggregations occurring on continental/insular platforms or large atolls; movements off the seamount may occur but were not detected. Results indicate the current seasonal closure inadequately protects the spawning population on Bajo de Sico and should be extended to the end of June.","[Tuohy, Evan; Scharer-Umpierre, Michelle; Appeldoorn, Richard] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA; [Penrod, Louis] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn & Marine Sci, Melbourne, FL USA",University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez; Florida Institute of Technology,"Tuohy, E (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA.",evan.tuohy@upr.edu,,,"National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15NMF4270341]; Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (CFMC); Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI)","National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (CFMC); Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI)","National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,Grant/Award Number: NA15NMF4270341;Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (CFMC); Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI)",,48,0,0,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

In two successive years, we surgically implanted transmitters in male and female bonefish (n = 60) and examined their movement patterns within the array. Eight bonefish surgically implanted with transmitters as part of an earlier study were also tracked. In 2009, the telemetry information was complemented with snorkeling observations, underwater video, and manual tracking of the same acoustically tagged fish, as well as fish (n = 3) gastrically implanted with continuous transmitters. During a period of 4-7 days spanning the full and new moons, primarily between October and May, bonefish moved from their typical shallow flats and aggregated at sites in close proximity to the deep water drop-off of the Exuma Sound. Localized movements of the large schools of bonefish (often > 1,000 fish) at these presumptive pre-spawning aggregation sites included brief trips (< 8 h) just after sunset until just prior to sunrise to the abyssal wall at the edge of the Exuma Sound (i.e., > 1,000 m depth). Tagged bonefish detected at these aggregation sites were subsequently detected back in the tidal creeks and coastal flats shortly after new and full moons and remained at these more typical shallow sites (i.e., < 2 m depth). Although we did not directly observe spawning events, we did observe ventral nudging and porpoising behaviors, which are potentially associated with courtship. Timing of the observed movements and possible courtship behaviors was coincident with periods when gametes were well developed. Collectively, our study provides the first objective evidence suggesting that the aggregation and seasonal migration of bonefish to deep shelf environments during certain moon phases is for spawning.","[Danylchuk, Andy J.; Haak, Christopher R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Danylchuk, Andy J.; Cooke, Steven J.; Goldberg, Tony L.; Suski, Cory D.; Murchie, Karen J.; Danylchuk, Sascha E.; Shultz, Aaron D.; Haak, Christopher R.; Brooks, Edd J.; Oronti, Annabelle; Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Flats Ecol & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Cooke, Steven J.; Murchie, Karen J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Suski, Cory D.; Shultz, Aaron D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Brooks, Edd J.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Carleton University; Carleton University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Plymouth; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Danylchuk, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 311 Holdsworth Hall,160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",danylchuk@eco.umass.edu,"Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Brooks, Edward/G-4697-2011","Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659","Bonefish and Tarpon Trust; Patagonia's World Trout Initiative; Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation; Baldwin Foundation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Carleton University; Cape Eleuthera Foundation; University of Illinois; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CGSD; Bahamas Department of Marine Resources; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture; Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and Department of Environmental Conservation [MAS00987]","Bonefish and Tarpon Trust; Patagonia's World Trout Initiative; Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation; Baldwin Foundation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Carleton University; Cape Eleuthera Foundation; University of Illinois; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CGSD(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Bahamas Department of Marine Resources; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and Department of Environmental Conservation","We gratefully acknowledge the staff, students, and volunteers of the Cape Eleuthera Institute and The Island School for logistical support and assistance with fieldwork, and in particular S.

We used a combination of laboratory and field approaches to study the thermal biology of bonefish, Albula vulpes, a fish species that relies on nearshore intertidal habitats throughout the Caribbean. The critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for bonefish was determined to be 36.4 +/- 0.5 and 37.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C for fish acclimated to 27.3 +/- 1.3 and 30.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C, respectively, and these tolerances are below maximal temperatures recorded in the tropical tidal habitats where bonefish frequently reside (i.e., up to 40.6 degrees C). In addition, daily temperatures can fluctuate up to 11.4 degrees C over a 24-h period emphasizing the dramatic range of temperatures that could be experienced by bonefish on a diel basis. Use of an acoustic telemetry array to monitor bonefish movements coupled with hourly temperature data collected within tidal creeks revealed a significant positive relationship between the amount of time bonefish spent in the upper portions of the creeks with the increasing maximal water temperature. This behavior is likely in response to feeding requirements necessary to fuel elevated metabolic demands when water temperatures generally warm, and also to avoid predators. For fish held in the laboratory, reaching CTMax temperatures elicited a secondary stress response that included an increase in blood lactate, glucose, and potassium levels. A field study that involved exposing fish to a standardized handling stressor at temperatures approaching their CTMax generated severe physiological disturbances relative to fish exposed to the same stressor at cooler temperatures. In addition, evaluation of the short-term survival of bonefish after surgical implantation of telemetry tags revealed that there was a positive relationship between water temperature at time of tagging and mortality. Collectively, the data from these laboratory and field studies suggest that bonefish occupy habitats that approach their laboratory-determined CTMax and can apparently do so without significant sub-lethal physiological consequences or mortality, except when exposed to additional stressors.

Thus the rise in acoustic energy associated with increasing human activity in the ocean has potential to impact the lives of marine animals. Thirty years ago marine bioacoustics primarily focused on evaluating effects of human-generated sound on hearing and behavior by testing captive animals and visually observing wild animals. Since that time rapidly changing electronic and computing technologies have yielded three tools that revolutionized how bioacousticians study marine animals. These tools are (1) portable systems for measuring electrophysiological auditory evoked potentials, (2) miniaturized tags equipped with positioning sensors and acoustic recording devices for continuous short-term acoustical observation rather than intermittent visual observation, and (3) passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems for remote long-term acoustic observations at specific locations. The beauty of these breakthroughs is their direct applicability to wild animals in natural habitats rather than only to animals held in captivity. Hearing capabilities of many wild species including polar bears, beaked whales, and reef fishes have now been assessed by measuring their auditory evoked potentials. Miniaturized acoustic tags temporarily attached to an animal to record its movements and acoustic environment have revealed the acoustic foraging behavior of sperm and beaked whales. Now tags are being adapted to fishes in effort to understand their behavior in the presence of noise. Moving and static PAM systems automatically detect and characterize biological and physical features of an ocean area without adding any acoustic energy to the environment. PAM is becoming a powerful technique for understanding and managing marine habitats. This paper will review the influence of these transformative tools on the knowledge base of marine bioacoustics and elucidation of relationships between marine animals and their acoustic environment, leading to a new, rapidly growing field of marine acoustic ecology.","[Hastings, Mardi C.] Georgia Inst Technol, GW Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Au, Whitlow W.

However, few studies have focused on the fine-scale movements related to reproduction, a key feature in a population's perpetuation. Knowledge of movements modulated by reproduction is particularly important since migrations towards spawning grounds may increase the vulnerability to threats if these occur outside protected areas. Further, reproductive behavioural polymorphism is widely understudied but may affect reproductive success. In this work, we used acoustic telemetry to study a harvested fish, Diplodus sargus, within a small no-take zone in Portugal. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to focus on both the environmental and spatial features affecting D. sargus reproduction and the first to explore intraspecific variability of spawning movements. We report, during the spawning period, short-term (<1 d) and synchronised wider movements towards the open sea and deeper areas-'extraordinary movements'-involving 34% of the individuals. These extraordinary movements were associated with environmental factors known to trigger reproduction in this species (low but increasing photoperiod and temperature, waxing and full moon phases). Our results suggest that different behavioural groups (residents, commuters and low site-attached fish) exhibiting differences in spatial use may aggregate and spawn simultaneously, which may contribute to the maintenance of behavioural polymorphisms and the species' evolutionary adaptability. These findings have implications for the conservation of D. sargus and are relevant to other species that also conduct such critical migrations. Our results should enable adaptive management of fisheries targeting this species.","[Pedaccini, Marie; Sousa, Ines; Bentes, Luis; DeBenito-Abello, Carmela; Goncalves, Jorge M.

Albula vulpes is a species of bonefish that is an economically and culturally important sportfish found throughout the Caribbean and that exhibits genetic connectivity among geographically distant populations. We created ontogenetically relevant biophysical models for bonefish larval dispersal based upon multiple observed spawning events in Abaco, The Bahamas in 2013, 2018, and 2019. Biological parameterizations were informed through active acoustic telemetry, CTD casts, captive larval rearing, and field collections of related albulids and anguillids. Ocean conditions were derived from the Regional Navy Coastal Ocean Model American Seas dataset. Each spawning event was simulated 100 times using the program Ichthyop. Ten-thousand particles were released at observed and putative spawning locations and were allowed to disperse for the full 71-day pelagic larval duration for A. vulpes. Settlement densities in defined settlement zones were assessed along with interactions with oceanographic features. The prevailing Northern dispersal paradigm exhibited strong connectivity with Grand Bahama, the Berry Islands, Andros, and self-recruitment to lower and upper Abaco. Ephemeral gyres and flow direction within Northwest and Northeast Providence Channels were shown to have important roles in larval retention to the Bahamian Archipelago. Larval development environments for larvae settling upon different islands showed few differences and dispersal was closely associated with the thermocline. Settlement patterns informed the suggestion for expansion of conservation parks in Grand Bahama, Abaco, and Andros, and the creation of a parks in Eleuthera and the Berry Islands to protect fisheries. Further observation of spawning events and the creation of biophysical models will help to maximize protection for bonefish spawning locations and nursery habitat, and may help to predict year-class strength for bonefish stocks throughout the Greater Caribbean.","[Lombardo, Steven M.; Cherubin, Laurent M.; Adams, Aaron J.; Wills, Paul S.; Ajemian, Matthew J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Adams, Aaron J.] Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, Miami, FL USA; [Shenker, Jonathan M.] Florida Inst Technol, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA; [Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation; Florida Institute of Technology; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Lombardo, SM (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.",lombardo.steven.m@gmail.com,"Lombardo, Steven/JDV-7193-2023; Shenker, Jonathan/HGT-9927-2022","Wills, Paul/0000-0001-5193-0142; Lombardo, Steven/0000-0002-2954-6328; Shenker, Jonathan/0000-0002-7013-0877",National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Bonefish Tarpon Trust,National Fish and Wildlife Foundation; Bonefish Tarpon Trust,"This work was funded through a grant given by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to Bonefish & Tarpon Trust and by Bonefish & Tarpon Trust research funds awarded to AJA, JMS, PSW, and MJA.

Giant trevally Caranx ignobilis are ecologically important top predatory fish targeted in both recreational and commercial fisheries; however, little is known about their aggregation dynamics or susceptibility to overexploitation. This study employed acoustic telemetry to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of one of the largest known aggregations of this species over a 3 yr period in a marine protected area in Mozambique, West Indian Ocean. Tagged fish were monitored for between 386 and 1176 d, during which they exhibited distinct aggregative periods in austral spring and summer. The detection frequency of fish at the aggregation site was significantly associated with rising mean sea temperatures and the full moon period. Whilst at the aggregation site, fish exhibited clear patterns of diel periodicity, with maximum hourly detections recorded during midday. All fish exhibited periods of absence from the aggregation site between summer seasons, in which time many of them ranged across an international border for distances of between 11 and 633 km before returning to aggregate at the same site in the following season. These results confirm that the studied giant trevally aggregation is temporally and spatially predictable, and consistent with a transient site-specific fish spawning aggregation. The spatiotemporal predictability of the aggregation highlights the need for the effective management of this transboundary population of giant trevally, for which this study has provided conservation management recommendations.","[Daly, Ryan; Filmalter, John D.; Bennett, Rhett H.; Cowley, Paul D.] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Private Bag 1015, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Daly, Ryan; Mann, Bruce Q.; Dunlop, Stuart W.] Oceanog Res Inst, POB 10712, ZA-4056 Durban, South Africa; [Daly, Ryan; Daly, Clare A.

However, to benefit local fisheries through spillover, the species in the reserves must also be able to migrate to unprotected areas. We evaluated the optimal design of marine reserves for protecting and promoting spillover of a commercially important parrotfish, Sparisoma cretense (Linnaeus, 1758), by empirically quantifying short- and long-term movements of individuals originally captured inside and outside a small reserve in the Azores Islands (mid-Atlantic). Movements were quantified using active tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-recapture. We found that the dual social organization of the species determined the individuals' movements and habitat use. Haremic fish occupied small HRs associated with permanently established male territories in high energy reef areas. Group (schooling) fish spent most of their time in sheltered reefs but expanded their HRs during the spawning season with daily migrations to the 'territorial' areas. S. cretense HR sizes were considerably larger than those previously reported for tropical parrotfishes. Passive acoustic monitoring indicated very high site fidelity and minimal dispersion for up to 30 mo. This study demonstrates that residency of adult parrotfish can last for years. Several individuals emigrated to the reserve from neighbouring areas and some of them relocated thereafter. We suggest that a network of adequately enforced marine reserves of small to medium size (ca. 1 to 5 km(2)) containing suitable habitat diversity can effectively protect core populations of S. cretense, but benefits to adjacent fisheries through spillover will be limited to the areas adjacent to the reserve boundaries.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589",,,,,31,96,110,0,38,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

An 11 month time series of acoustic data from fixed recorders deployed at a known E. morio aggregation site showed that E. morio produce sounds throughout the day and during all months of the year. Increased calling (number of files containing E. morio sound) was correlated to sunrise and sunset, and peaked in late summer (July and August) and early winter (November and December). Due to the ubiquitous production of sound, large-scale spatial mapping across the WFS of E. morio sound production was feasible using recordings from shorter duration-fixed location recorders and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Epinephelus morio were primarily recorded in waters 15-93m deep, with increased sound production detected in hard bottom areas and within the Steamboat Lumps Marine Protected Area (Steamboat Lumps). AUV tracks through Steamboat Lumps, an offshore marine reserve where E. morio hole excavations have been previously mapped, showed that hydrophone-integrated AUVs could accurately map the location of soniferous fish over spatial scales of <1km.

The aggregation spans 125 m along the northern channel wall, with the highest densities of fish from 9 to 13 m and <15 m from the wall where current velocities are <0.25 m s(-1). The aggregation occurs within an indent in the channel wall where an abrupt change in bathymetry creates a visible eddy-like feature during outgoing tides. The aggregation forms year-round, for 6 d each moon cycle, starting 1 d before the full moon to 4 d after. During the study, 4 tagged fish returned to the site for 6 consecutive lunar cycles; however, residency times within aggregation periods was similar to 1.5 d on average. Densely aggregated fish were present during the day, but migration patterns of tagged fish revealed regular evening migrations to and from the channel mouth, consistently at the highest tide of the day, a behavior assumed for spawning. These observations reveal some physical processes and biological patterns surrounding the formation and function of fish aggregations.","[Cimino, Megan; Schramek, Travis; Terrill, Eric] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Colin, Patrick; Lindfield, Steven] Coral Reef Res Fdn, Koror 96940, PW, Palau; [Domeier, Michael] Marine Conservat Sci Inst, Fallbrook, CA 92028 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"Cimino, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mcimino@ucsd.edu,"Terrill, Eric/ABA-4169-2021; Schramek, Travis/R-9736-2017; Lindfield, Steven John/HGE-5640-2022","Terrill, Eric/0000-0003-1807-8351; Lindfield, Steven John/0000-0002-7933-6206","National Geographic Society/Waitt Grants Program [2281-2]; US Office of Naval Research Flow Encountering Abrupt Topography, Department Research Initiative; Friedkin Foundation","National Geographic Society/Waitt Grants Program(National Geographic Society); US Office of Naval Research Flow Encountering Abrupt Topography, Department Research Initiative(United States Department of DefenseUnited States NavyOffice of Naval Research); Friedkin Foundation(ACEV Foundation)","This research was supported by the National Geographic Society/Waitt Grants Program (2281-2) and the US Office of Naval Research Flow Encountering Abrupt Topography, Department Research Initiative.

Here, we adopted a combined approach, integrating restriction-siteassociated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and acoustic telemetry to establish country-wide demographic structure, diversity and connectivity, and the origins of Nassau grouper using an active fish spawning aggregation (FSA) in the central Bahamas. RAD-seq analysis of 94 Nassau grouper sampled from nine locations in The Bahamas generated a working dataset of 13,241 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Similar levels of genetic diversity were found among sampled locations. Evidence of population sub-structuring across The Bahamas was demonstrated and supported by discriminate analysis of principal components (DAPCs) along with analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs). Associated acoustic telemetry data indicated Nassau grouper tagged at an active FSA in the central Bahamas during the 2016-2017 spawning season migrated to the Exumas at the conclusion of the spawning period. Telemetry data suggest the likely origins of five individuals, which traveled one-way distances of up to 176 km from the FSA in the central Bahamas to two sites within a no-take marine protected area (MPA). Analyses of high-resolution SNP markers (including candidate loci under selection) illustrated patterns of spatial structure and genetic connectivity not reflected by telemetry data alone. Nassau grouper from Exuma and Long Island appear to have genetic signatures that differ from other islands and from the Hail Mary FSA. Collectively, these findings provide novel information on the intraspecific population dynamics of Nassau grouper within The Bahamian archipelago and within an active FSA.","[Sherman, Krista D.; Paris, Josie; King, Robert Andrew; Moore, Karen A.; Tyler, Charles R.; Stevens, Jamie R.] Univ Exeter, Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Sherman, Krista D.; Stump, Kristine] John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Sherman, Krista D.; Dahlgren, Craig P.; Knowles, Lindy C.] Bahamas Natl Trust, Sci & Policy, Nassau, Bahamas; [Sherman, Krista D.; Dahlgren, Craig P.] Perry Inst Marine Sci, Waitsfield, VT 05673 USA; [Stump, Kristine] Field Lab Consulting LLC, Palmetto, FL USA",University of Exeter,"Sherman, KD (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Biosci, Exeter, Devon, England.;Sherman, KD (corresponding author), John G Shedd Aquarium, Daniel P Haerther Ctr Conservat & Res, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.;Sherman, KD (corresponding author), Bahamas Natl Trust, Sci & Policy, Nassau, Bahamas.;Sherman, KD (corresponding author), Perry Inst Marine Sci, Waitsfield, VT 05673 USA.",krista.sherman@perryinstitute.org,"Stevens, Jamie/O-7216-2019; Paris, Josephine Rosanna/J-1981-2014","Knowles, Lindy/0000-0001-9186-8996; Sherman, Krista/0000-0001-9859-8781; Paris, Josephine Rosanna/0000-0001-6868-3416",Save Our Seas Foundation [365]; Lyford Cay Foundation via the Shirley Oakes Butler Charitable Trust scholarship; Shedd Aquarium,Save Our Seas Foundation; Lyford Cay Foundation via the Shirley Oakes Butler Charitable Trust scholarship; Shedd Aquarium,RAD-sequencing was funded by the Save Our Seas Foundation (small Grant No. 365) and Lyford Cay Foundation via the Shirley Oakes Butler Charitable Trust scholarship to KDS.

Leopard coralgrouper Plectropomus leopardus is one of the main targeted fishery species in the Great Barrier Reef; however, there is no information on long-term movement patterns based on continuous and frequent data points. The objective of this study was to determine long-term space use of P. leopardus and identify any seasonal variation in movement trends. A total of 124 P. leopardus were implanted with V13P acoustic transmitters between 2010 and 2012 and passively tracked. Forty-five VR2W receivers were deployed at 2 reefs to track the movements of tagged individuals. The influence of time of day, season, tagging year, location, and water temperature on several movement measures was investigated. Of the 124 fish tagged, 74 individuals had sufficient detections to be included in analysis of horizontal movement, and 55 were used to analyse vertical movements. Results showed increased horizontal movements and higher activity in deeper water during the day in the austral summer. Movement patterns, both vertically and horizontally, appeared to be influenced by water temperature, but also corresponded with spawning season. Despite increased movements during summer, individuals typically remained in a small area similar to 0.5 km(2) throughout detection periods, indicating that long-range spawning-related movements are rare and that adequate resources are obtained within a small section of habitat year-round. This study provides long-term (similar to 3 yr) movement data for an economically significant reef fish and increases knowledge of spatial and temporal space use patterns.","[Matley, J.

This study investigates area utilisation and activity patterns of 13 adult roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae) using telemetry and underwater observations. Acoustic transmitters implanted into C. laticeps in tanks had no apparent effects on growth and mobility. Natural behaviour of the treated fish in the field was verified by SCUBA divers. Manual boat- and diver-based tracking was carried out inside the Castle Rock MPA, False Bay, South Africa, over a 17-month period. A radio acoustic positioning system (VRAP, VEMCO Ltd) was used to record automatically fish positions over two 1-month periods during and after the spawning season of roman. Manually recorded fish positions and VRAP positions inside the triangle of buoys within the system were accurate within 10m; deviations increased with increased distance of the fish from the centre of the system and during unfavourable sea conditions. Analysis of movement data using a 95% fixed kernel algorithm suggests that roman occupy small home ranges of between 1 000m(2) and 3 000m(2), which shows that this species is well suited for protection in small MPAs. Interestingly, the home range size did not seem to be related to fish size or habitat quality. Swimming activity decreased at night. During periods of cold-water upwelling, fish retreated into caves. During the spawning season, females extended their home ranges, which result in a 'spill over' effect of adult fish into fishing areas.","Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa; Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Kerwath, SE (corresponding author), Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, Private Bag X2, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa.",skerwath@deat.gov.za,"Sauer, Warwick/GJI-2267-2022","Sauer, Warwick/0000-0002-9756-1757; Attwood, Colin/0000-0002-1045-3439; Kerwath, Sven/0000-0003-2751-5015",,,,,40,35,38,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1814-232X,1814-2338,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

Movements of an important recreational target species from the Mediterranean Sea, the parrotfish Sparisoma cretense. were determined in a marine protected area using passive acoustic telemetry, to evaluate site fidelity and homing, quantify home range and identify temporal patterns. Six adult parrotfish (20.8-29.8 cm total length) were caught along the north-eastern coast of Lampedusa (Italy) and surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Three fish were caught and released at the same site within the integral (i.e. no entry-no take) reserve, whereas the others were caught outside the reserve boundary and released at the mid reserve 0.5 km apart. Two of the three fish that were released away from the capture site demonstrated homing abilities. Four fish showed a strong site fidelity, whereas the others moved frequently in and out of the monitoring area. Home range sizes estimated over the period of monitoring (up to 207 days) varied from 70,387 to 256,398 m(2), with core areas of 16,688 to 84,946 m(2). Home range size did not differ significantly between day and night. Home ranges of all fish extended beyond the reserve boundaries, showing example of potential spillover into take zones. Temporal activity patterns of fish were diurnal with a dominant diel rhythm, likely due to a resting behaviour at night. Though not specifically designed to protect exploited fish, the marine reserve of Lampedusa seems adequate for the conservation and management of S. cretense. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to its large size and complex life history characteristics, it is vulnerable to overfishing and has undergone substantial population declines in parts of its range. Knowledge of the species' movement ecology is currently limited to only 2 previous studies, and very little is known about populations in the western Indian Ocean. The present study aimed to use passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the importance of a remote coral reef to a population of humphead wrasse in the Republic of Seychelles, and subsequently assess the efficacy of a proposed marine protected area at this location for protection of the species. Tagged fish (n = 20) exhibited persistent (> 500 d) site fidelity, with low dispersal distances (mean +/- SD: 6.44 +/- 4.0 km) and restricted core activity spaces (50% Brownian bridge kernel utilization density: 0.91 +/- 0.61 km(2)). Additionally, the study site was home to a group of large (total length 97.9 +/- 20.6 cm) and currently unexploited humphead wrasse that showed longterm predictable site fidelity and thus could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. The establishment of a proposed no-take marine protected area at the study site would encompass the core home range area of all tagged humphead wrasse and could effectively conserve this stronghold of Endangered fish to ensure the persistence of the species in Seychelles waters.","[Daly, Ryan; Peel, Lauren R.; Gordon, Luke; Lea, James S.

Many papers have recently been published on fish spawning aggregations (FSAs), in which numerous fish migrate to specific sites for spawning, yet little is known about the relationship between individual energetic state and reproductive behaviour. We tested whether the individual energetic state affected the reproductive behaviour in male white-streaked grouper Epinephelus ongus, a species that forms FSAs. Body composition measurement of market specimens suggests that male E. ongus feed less and mainly use their lipid reserves for metabolism and testis development during the spawning season. An integrative analysis of body composition and acoustic telemetry data showed that there is a positive relationship between pre-migration lipid density and duration away from the resident area for migration and reproduction (duration away). These results indicate that fatter males with higher lipid density spent longer periods outside of the resident area, which may enhance the susceptibility of these individuals to intensive fishing pressure at the FSA site. Furthermore, the lipid expenditure during the duration away estimated in this study corresponded well with the energy expenditure for metabolism and testis development estimated through the metabolic theory of ecology, suggesting that we could accurately estimate the energy requirement for reproductive behaviours. This study highlights the importance of linking energy reserves to reproductive behaviours in other fishes forming spawning aggregations.","[Kawabata, Yuuki; Yamamoto, Ken; Yamaguchi, Tomofumi; Kawabe, Ryo; Nishihara, Gregory N.; Soyano, Kiyoshi] Nagasaki Univ, Inst East China Sea Res, Taira, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Nanami, Atsushi; Sato, Taku; Yamaguchi, Tomofumi] Fisheries Res Agcy, Res Ctr Sub Trop Fisheries, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Ishigaki 9070451, Japan; [Kuwahara, Koichi; Koga, Megumi; Kawaguchi, Kazuhiro] Nagasaki Prefectural Inst Fisheries, Taira, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Ohta, Itaru] Okinawa Prefectural Fisheries Res & Extens Ctr, Itoman, Okinawa 9010354, Japan; [Yagi, Mitsuharu] Nagasaki Univ, Fac Fisheries, Bunkyo Ku, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan",Nagasaki University; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Nagasaki University,"Kawabata, Y (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Inst East China Sea Res, Taira, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan.",yuuki-k@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,"Kawabata, Yuuki/H-4109-2019; Nishihara, Gregory/H-6808-2019","Yagi, Mitsuharu/0000-0002-1974-3280; Kawabe, Ryo/0000-0002-4030-6667; Nishihara, Gregory/0000-0003-2543-1301","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25870529, 23380113]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K18612, 25870529, 23380113] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We acknowledge T.

We tagged 355 green sturgeon with acoustic transmitters on their spawning grounds and in known nonspawning aggregation sites and examined their movement among these sites and other potentially important locations using automated data-logging hydrophones. We found that green sturgeon inhabit a number of estuarine and coastal sites over the summer, including the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor, and the estuaries of certain smaller rivers in Oregon, especially the Umpqua River estuary. Green sturgeon from different natal rivers exhibited different patterns of habitat use; most notably, San Francisco Bay was used only by Sacramento River fish, while the Umpqua River estuary was used mostly by fish from the Klamath and Rogue rivers. Earlier work, based on analysis of microsatellite markers, suggested that the Columbia River mixed stock was mainly composed of fish from the Sacramento River, but our results indicate that fish from the Rogue and Klamath River populations frequently use the Columbia River as well. We also found evidence for the existence of migratory contingents within spawning populations. Our findings have significant implications for the management of the threatened Sacramento River population of green sturgeon, which migrates to inland waters outside of California where anthropogenic impacts, including fisheries bycatch and water pollution, may be a concern. Our results also illustrate the utility of acoustic tracking to elucidate the migratory behavior of animals that are otherwise difficult to observe.","[Lindley, Steven T.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Erickson, Daniel L.] Bronx Zoo, Marine Program, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Moser, Mary L.; Williams, Greg] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Langness, Olaf P.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Vancouver, WA 98661 USA; [McCovey, Barry W., Jr.; Belchik, Michael] Yurok Tribal Fisheries Program, Weitchpec, CA 95546 USA; [Vogel, Dave] Nat Resource Scientists Inc, Red Bluff, CA 96080 USA; [Pinnix, William] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Kelly, John T.; Heublein, Joseph C.; Klimley, A.

Methods are becoming increasingly standardized allowing for meaningful comparison between sites, times and species. Methods can be fishery-dependent (gathering data from captured fishes) or -independent (observational, instrumental physical, interview data) within the subject areas of aggregation (1) discovery, (2) composition, (3) dynamics, (4) life history parameters and (5) physical parameters. Methods for each are summarized with selected subjects explored in more detail. Particularly problematic areas for data gathering have been fishery-independent determination of numbers and/or sizes of fishes and their distribution within aggregations and the larger environment. GPS based methods of mapping aggregation location, extent and fish density provide discrete snapshots of an aggregation, allowing visualization of dynamics over days to years and are repeatable any time in the future by others. Digital imaging (still and video) allows documentation previously impossible. Acoustic tagging, particularly alongside conventional tagging, allows delineating spatial and temporal aspects of aggregations. Hydroacoustic surveys are promising, but require validation of data on species present, fish numbers and their sizes. Aggregation sites should be instrumented to record physical data (e.g. temperature, currents, light) ideally year round, rather than just during aggregation, to allow comparison of aggregation periods with the entire year, and non-aggregation sites also evaluated for comparison Detailed bathymetric mapping of sites is important and feasible and allows visualization of geomorphology in relation to aggregations.","Coral Reef Res Fdn, Koror 96940, Palau",,"Colin, PL (corresponding author), Coral Reef Res Fdn, POB 1765, Koror 96940, Palau.",crrf@palaunet.com,,,,,,,89,22,24,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1367-8396,,978-94-007-1979-8,FISH FISH SER,Fish Fisheries Series,,2012,35,,,,,,285,329,,10.1007/978-94-007-1980-4_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1980-4_9,10.1007/978-94-007-1980-4,,45,Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Fisheries; Marine & Freshwater Biology,BZG51,,,,,2025-05-02,WOS:000301515300009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the movements of a large coral reef top predator (Aprion virescens, Lutjanidae; Hawaiian name 'uku') at five atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument (NWHIMNM) from May 2005 to September 2006. The study atolls were located between 23.8 degrees N, 166.2 degrees W and 28.5 degrees N, 178.3 degrees W, and were separated from their nearest receiver-equipped neighbor by distances ranging from 100 to 478 km. No inter-atoll movements by uku were detected but individuals were seasonally site-attached to core activity areas of up to 12 km in length, and ranged up to 19 km across atolls. Within their core areas, tagged uku exhibited diel and tidal habitat shifts, with the latter resulting in round trips of up to 24 km in 24 h. Seasonal uku migrations resulted in extended winter (October-April) absences from summer (May-September) core activity areas and may be linked to summer spawning. Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries. However, this would still require relatively large MPAs (12 km in length) to contain uku short-term (diel and tidal) movements, and seasonal migrations would still take uku beyond the boundaries of MPAs of this size. These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, PO Box 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,50,65,78,0,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

This includes the optimal design of networks of marine reserves, as movements of fish are a major determinant for the reserve effect (increase in size and number inside reserves) and spillover effect (emigration from reserves). The increasing use of acoustic telemetry techniques, particularly passive acoustic arrays, is providing much of that information, but studies have typically used one specific approach at a specific spatial-temporal scale. We studied movement patterns, habitat use and dispersal in the red porgy, Pagrus pagrus (a commercially important species) in the Azores islands, mid-north Atlantic, with the aim of supporting the design of marine reserves that would protect local populations while enhancing fisheries. Movements were quantified using: (1) short-term active acoustic tracking; (2) multi-year passive acoustic monitoring; and (3) standard tag-release experiments in the Faial Channel. We found the short-term home ranges of red porgy to be quite large for a reef fish - up to 50 ha. Further-more, frequent short-term displacements of up to 9 km and periodic absences from main core activity areas indicate that HR varies considerably in size and location throughout the year. Home range expansion occurred mostly during the protracted period of spawning activity, but we saw no evidence for spawning aggregations. We found evidence that individuals of smaller size utilize larger home ranges and are less site-specific, supporting the hypothesis that dispersal in the red porgy is largely determined by ontogenic changes. Large individual variability in both short-term and long-term movement patterns accounted for some emigrations from tagging sites and for one documented relocation. These findings indicate that adequate protection of subpopulations of red porgy will not be achieved using small, isolated reserves (1 to 5 km(2)), but reserves of size in the order of tens of km(2) and spaced a few kilometers apart should provide protection while promoting emigration (spillover) of red porgy from reserves to neighboring grounds. This study shows that the combination of spatial and temporal scales and approaches is needed to capture a realistic picture of the full suite of spatial behaviors used throughout a species' life history.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Guedes, Rui; Tempera, Fernando; Holland, Kim N.; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, IMAR DOP, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, IMAR DOP, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013; Tempera, Fernando/Q-1781-2018","Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589; Tempera, Fernando/0000-0001-9495-3731; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532",FCT/MCTES; Azorean DRCT; MAREFISH [FCT - POCTI/BSE/41207/2001]; MARMACII [IIIb-03/MAC/4.2/A2/2004],FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Azorean DRCT; MAREFISH; MARMACII,"We sincerely thank H.

Here, we present the first description of the acoustic ecology of Amphyichtys cryptocentrus, a new-world toadfish species, distributed across the southern Caribbean Sea. We recorded fourteen individuals in a seagrass habitat over six nights in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago. Like other toadfishes, A. cryptocentrus produces compound calls with broadband and tonal components; a typical call contains 1-2 grunts, followed by 1-2 boops (average fundamental frequency = 112 Hz, average source level = 138 dB re:1 mu Pa RMS). While we observed relatively low between-individual variation in frequency components, our results show that individuals can be readily identified based on their call composition and call rate. This suggests that each toadfish has an individual voice, which may transmit selection-linked information to females about body condition, status, or motivation to mate. We also observed that toadfish produced grunts during neighbors' calls, a previously-described aggressive behavior called acoustic tagging, which can intercept a potential rival's mating advertisement. Our findings suggest that A. cryptocentrus (and its population in Bocas del Toro, in particular) represents a useful system for the study of fish bioacoustics and behavioral ecology, and we demonstrate that acoustic communication represents a major aspect of social behavior in coral reef fishes.","[Staaterman, Erica; Brandl, Simon J.; Hauer, Michelle] Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tennenbaum Marine Observ Network, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA; [Casey, Jordan M.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Invertebrate Zool, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Staaterman, Erica; Gallagher, Austin J.] Beneath Waves Inc, Herndon, VA 20172 USA; [Staaterman, Erica; Brandl, Simon J.; Gallagher, Austin J.] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Bocas Del Toro, Panama; [Rice, Aaron N.] Cornell Univ, Bioacoust Res Program, Cornell Lab Ornithol, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Staaterman, Erica] Bur Ocean Energy Management, Sterling, VA 20166 USA; [Brandl, Simon J.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History; Smithsonian Institution; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute; Cornell University; Simon Fraser University,"Staaterman, E (corresponding author), Smithsonian Environm Res Ctr, Tennenbaum Marine Observ Network, POB 28, Edgewater, MD 21037 USA.",staatermane@si.edu,"Brandl, Simon/H-4150-2019; Rice, Aaron/A-1292-2007","Casey, Jordan/0000-0002-2434-7207; Brandl, Simon/0000-0002-6649-2496; Rice, Aaron/0000-0002-8598-9705",Smithsonian MarineGEO Post-doctoral fellowships; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's visiting research fellowship; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's internship program,Smithsonian MarineGEO Post-doctoral fellowships; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute's visiting research fellowship; Smithsonian Environmental Research Center's internship program,"We thank the team at the Bocas del Toro research station, the students in the 2016 Three Seas Program, and Matt Ogburn and Denise Breitburg for their support with this project.

Pre-spawning cod were tagged (200 DSTs, 26 acoustic tags) as they neared a known spawning ground. Fish equipped with acoustic tags were relocated by a receiver array and a boat-mounted directional receiver over the following eight weeks. Group activity was analyzed by minimum convex polygon (MCP), and individual kernel distribution estimates were created for 13 fish. Individual cod utilized spawning areas <60 km(2) in size (mean 41 km(2)) with a high degree of spatial overlap. Activity was distributed along a roughly V-shaped corridor bounded by elevated bottom features. Cod aggregated around specific humps and ridges, and there were two separate weeks during the two-month study when the majority of cod converged on a single aggregation hot-spot. The last detection date for each cod was used as a proxy for departure date. Seven cod were tracked making rapid departures across the spawning ground in <24 h. Residence on the spawning ground ranged from 8 to 53 days (mean 30 days). Residence time was confirmed by DST data. Of the 26 recaptured cod whose DSTs were analyzed, 14 cod were observed to make clear deep-water (>100 m) shifts occurring 23-50 days after tagging. Data from three cod equipped with both an acoustic transmitter and a DST showed concurrence between last detections and deep-water shifts.

However, the extent to which these benefits occur is dependent on movement patterns of fish, for which there is a paucity of data, particularly for coral reef species. Eleven adult Kyphosus sectatrix were tracked [five in the Grand Caille marine reserve (MR) and six in the Petit Piton MR within the Soufriere Marine Management Area, St Lucia] from February to April 1999, using acoustic telemetry. Average number of days over which fish were tracked was 21.5 (range 5-51). Home range size of individuals, temporal use of space within the home range, and permeability of MR and habitat boundaries to fish movement were examined. Average minimum home range area of K. sectatrix was not significantly different between Grand Caille (30 514 m(2)) and Petit Piton (39 114 m(2)). However, the shape of home ranges was conspicuously different between the sites and reflected available reef shape, Individual home ranges overlapped strongly with those of other individuals at the same site, and use of space within the home range was generally restricted to a small number of preferred sites. Preferred sites were often shared among individuals and tended to be occupied at a specific time of day, with some sites were preferred in the morning and or afternoon, whilst others preferred during the middle of the day. Fidelity to a single sleeping-shelter site was high at night. MR boundaries over contiguous reef at Grand Caille were frequently crossed with individuals spending, on average, 63% of their time (range 37-94) outside the MR. This demonstrates the need for the MR boundary at this site to be implemented farther offshore to encompass the reef, if the MR is to better protect K sectatrix. At Petit Piton, where MR boundaries effectively encompass available reef, K sectatrix spent, on average, only 11% of their time (range 0-40) outside the protected area. At Grand Caille boundaries were crossed more readily (individuals spent an average of 18% of their time off reef) than at Petit Piton where individuals spent an average of 0.7% of their time off reef.

Temporal patterns and fish position were determined using a fixed-receiver array located in a marine protected area (MPA) in Palma Bay (Balearic Islands). Fish position as centre of activity (COA, the centre of the area the fish uses during a specific time) and space utilisation preferences could be described due to a receiver array design with a high range detection overlap (more densely distributed near the COA). There were significantly more detections per time unit during the day, which was interpreted as increased activity possibly related to feeding habits and social behaviour. S. cabrilla spent 95% of its time in an average area of 0.77 +/- 0.17 km(2), with a core area (50% of the time) of 0.10 +/- 0.29 km(2). The home range size was not related to fish size or diel pattern (i.e. the size of the daytime home range was not significantly different from the night range). The linearity index and the index of reuse (proxies of site fidelity) also demonstrated that this species has high site fidelity, which suggests that it is sedentary with a limited adult dispersal capacity. Two main habitats were observed in the study area, and S. cabrilla spent on average much less time in seagrass meadows (Posidonia oceanica beds) compared to soft, gravel and detritus bottoms. A relatively small MPA would be a useful management tool for establishing sustainable exploitation levels of this species.","[Alos, Josep; March, David; Palmer, Miquel; Morales-Nin, Beatriz] CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain; [Grau, Amalia] Lab Invest Marines & Aquicultura LIMIA, Port Dandratx 07157, Illes Baleares, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Alós, J (corresponding author), CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain.",pep.alos@uib.es,"Palmer, Miquel/E-3561-2013; March, David/G-6489-2014","Miquel, Palmer/0000-0002-7875-3673; Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539; March, David/0000-0002-6118-761X; Grau, Amalia/0000-0002-6461-6985; Morales-Nin, Beatriz/0000-0002-7264-0918","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2008-00958]; FPI, MICINN","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); FPI, MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","We thank the staff of the Direccio General de Pesca (Govern de les Illes Balears) and the researchers who helped with the experimental fishing and logistic procedures, especially A.

One of the most fundamental unresolved issues in understanding animal navigation is how the brain represents spatial information. Although navigation has been studied extensively in many taxa, the key efforts to determine the neural basis of navigation have focused on mammals, usually in lab experiments, where the allocated space is typically very small; e.g., up to one order of magnitude the size of the animal, is limited by artificial walls, and contains only a few objects. This type of setting is vastly different from the habitat of animals in the wild, which is open in many cases and is virtually limitless in size compared to its inhabitants. Thus, a fundamental open question in animal navigation is whether small-scale, spatially confined, and artificially crafted lab experiments indeed reveal how navigation is enacted in the real world. This question is difficult to study given the technical problems associated with in vivo electrophysiology in natural settings. Here, we argue that these difficulties can be overcome by implementing state of the art technology when studying the rivulated rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus as the model animal. As a first step toward this goal, using acoustic tracking of the reef, we demonstrate that individual S. rivulatus have a defined home range of about 200 m in length, from which they seldom venture. They repeatedly visit the same areas and return to the same sleeping grounds, thus providing evidence for their ability to navigate in the reef environment. Using a clustering algorithm to analyze segments of daily trajectories, we found evidence of specific repeating patterns in behavior within the home range of individual fish. Thus, S. rivulatus appears to have the ability to carry out its daily routines and revisit places of interest by employing sophisticated means of navigation while exploring its surroundings. In the future, using novel technologies for wireless recording from single cells of fish brains, S. rivulatus can emerge as an ideal system to study the neural basis of navigation in natural settings and lead to electrophysiology in the wild.","[Givon, Shachar; Kiflawi, Moshe; Segev, Ronen] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Givon, Shachar; Ben-Shahar, Ohad; Segev, Ronen] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Zlotowski Ctr Neurosci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Pickholtz, Renanel] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Pickholtz, Renanel; Kiflawi, Moshe] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, Elat, Israel; [Ben-Shahar, Ohad] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Comp Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel; [Segev, Ronen] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biomed Engn, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; Tel Aviv University; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev,"Segev, R (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, Beer Sheva, Israel.;Segev, R (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Zlotowski Ctr Neurosci, Beer Sheva, Israel.;Segev, R (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Biomed Engn, Beer Sheva, Israel.",ronensgv@bgu.ac.il,"Ben-Shahar, Ohad/F-8918-2015; KIFLAWI, MOSHE/AAH-7991-2021","Pickholtz, Renanel/0000-0001-7319-991X",,,,,35,4,4,0,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,1662-5110,,FRONT NEURAL CIRCUIT,Front.

Traditionally, stock assessments measure reproductive potential as spawning stock biomass or egg production and do not include other aspects of reproductive behavior. Red drum make an excellent case study to assess these other aspects, as (1) they are highly fecund, pelagic spawners, like most exploited marine fishes; (2) their life cycle is delineated between nursery (estuarine) and adult (coastal and offshore) habitat; and (3) they are managed at these two spatial scales. This study was conducted from August 2012 to December 2013 and integrates data from multiple methods and spatial scales. Aerial surveys were used for large-scale monitoring of aggregations off two known estuarine nursery areas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, USA. Capture-based sampling in Tampa Bay coastal (n = 2581) and estuarine waters (n = 158) was used to assess reproductive state and to confirm coastal spawning. To assess spatial dynamics, we acoustically tagged two population components in the Tampa Bay system, subadults from the estuary (n = 20) and adults from the coastal spawning site (n = 60). Behavioral plasticity was seen in subadult recruitment to coastal habitat, with some subadults maturing and recruiting before or during the spawning season and others (14 of 20 acoustically tagged fish) recruiting at the end of the 2012 spawning season. Both adults and recruited subadults (n = 29) were consequently detected in the Charlotte Harbor array, 132 km to the south. Spawning-site fidelity to the Tampa Bay spawning site occurred at both the population and individual scales. Aggregations consistently occurred in Tampa Bay coastal waters during the spawning season, and approximately two-thirds of tagged adults returned in the 2013 spawning season. A similar proportion of subadults returned to the Tampa Bay spawning site, exhibiting natal homing. However, these first-time spawners arrived later than repeat spawners and were detected over shorter time periods. This study, and others like it, demonstrates how integrating data from individuals tracked over space and time with more traditional population-based sampling is changing our understanding of ecological processes that affect marine fish productivity and our ability to manage for sustainablity.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Burnsed, Sarah L.

We used acoustic telemetry to quantify the movements of giant trevally, a large coral reef top predator, at 5 atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. We did not observe any inter-atoll movements but found that giant trevally were attached to core activity areas from which they made periodic atoll-wide excursions of up to 29 km. Within the core areas, the tagged fish exhibited diel habitat shifts. We identified Rapture Reef at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll as a spawning site, where giant trevally form seasonal mating aggregations. Giant trevally that use Rapture Reef as their core daytime area live there year-round, whereas those that occupy other areas of FFS migrate to Rapture Reef in the summertime during specific phases of the moon. Although giant trevally were wide-ranging and would require large marine protected areas (e.g. entire atolls or islands) to protect their entire range, core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally could be contained within relatively small marine protected areas. Identification of spawning sites could assist in the establishment of focused marine protected areas that, while quite small in size, could have significant impact in preserving the spawning biomass of this species. Very large marine protected areas are not feasible in most heavily populated areas, hence effective alternative management strategies must be found for this tishery-targeted, wide-ranging top predator. We suggest using a combination of relatively small marine protected areas, to protect core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally, and conventional measures such as minimum size or 'slot' limits to further safeguard spawning stocks.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,40,125,143,1,60,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Geomagnetic cues are thought to guide long-range navigation, while visual or olfactory cues allow animals to pinpoint precise locations, but the complete behavioral sequence is not yet understood. Terra Ceia Bay is a primary nursery area for blacktip sharks, Carcharhinus limbatus, on southwestern Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. Young-of-theyear animals show strong fidelity to a specific home range in the northeastern end of the bay and rapidly return when displaced. Older juveniles demonstrate annual philopatry for the first few years, migrating as far south as the Florida Keys each fall, then returning to Terra Ceia Bay each spring. To examine the sensory cues used in homing, we captured neonate (53 weeks old) blacktip sharks from within their home range, fitted them with acoustic tags, and translocated them to sites 8km away in adjacent Tampa Bay and released them. Intact animals returned to their home range, within 34 h on average, and remained there. With olfaction blocked, fewer animals returned to their home range and they took longer to do so, 130 h on average. However, they did not remain there but instead moved throughout Terra Ceia Bay and in and out of Tampa Bay. Since sharks from both treatments returned at night in tannic and turbid water, vision is likely not playing a major role in navigation by these animals. The animals in this study also returned on incoming or slack tides, suggesting that sharks, like many other fish, may use selective tidal stream transport to conserve energy and aid navigation during migration. Collectively, these results suggest that while other cues, possibly geomagnetic and/or tidal information, might guide sharks over long distances, olfactory cues are required for recognizing their specific home range.","[Gardiner, Jayne M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Gardiner, Jayne M.] New Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Mote Marine Lab, Behav Ecol & Physiol Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Hueter, Robert E.] Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Shark Res, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; State University System of Florida; New College Florida; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium,"Gardiner, JM (corresponding author), Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, 1600 Ken Thompson Pkwy, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.",jgardiner@ncf.edu,,"Gardiner, Jayne/0000-0002-9989-2891",Florida Sea Grant [PD-12-04]; Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship,Florida Sea Grant; Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship,This work was supported by Florida Sea Grant (PD-12-04) and a Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship [to J.M.G.].,,114,24,29,2,128,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

We analysed the vertical movements of silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus using pop-up archival tags deployed on 7 individuals in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean. The sharks changed depth predictably with water column thermal structure, moving deeper with seasonal increases in mixed layer depth while occupying a narrow ambient water temperature range around similar to 27 degrees C. At shorter timescales, higher resolution data from 5 tags showed that silvertip shark depth varied cyclically with surface light levels, increasing during daylight and on nights around the full moon. This matches the diel vertical migrations of many fish species, suggesting that the sharks' light-driven depth changes might relate to foraging. While most vertical movements (>98%) were within the mixed layer, deeper dives to 200-800 m occurred approximately every 3 d. High-resolution data from one recovered tag showed the shark ascending deep (>200 m) dives in 2 sharply defined phases, initially fast then slow. Analysis of dive profiles against dissolved oxygen (DO) data suggested that the shark may have ascended rapidly to escape low DO levels at depth, then reduced its ascent rate by 50-80% once DO levels increased. While a small sample, the electronic tags deployed in this study revealed the silvertip sharks' predictable use of mixed layer waters, narrow thermal range and apparent intolerance of hypoxic conditions. These characteristics may exacerbate the species' vulnerability as oceanic warming and shoaling oxygen minimum zones modify vertical habitat availability.","[Tickler, David M.; Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Ctr Marine Futures, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Carlisle, Aaron B.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA; [Chapple, Taylor K.] Oregon State Univ, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Chapple, Taylor K.; Dale, Jonathan J.; Castleton, Michael J.; Schallert, Robert J.; Block, Barbara A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Oceans Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Curnick, David J.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, Regents Pk, London NW1 4RY, England",University of Western Australia; University of Delaware; Oregon State University; Stanford University; Zoological Society of London,"Tickler, DM (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Ctr Marine Futures, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",davetickler@gmail.com,"Tickler, David/KIC-7386-2024","Curnick, David/0000-0002-3093-1282",Bertarelli Foundation Programme in Marine Science,Bertarelli Foundation Programme in Marine Science,"Field work was completed under research approvals from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the support of the Bertarelli Foundation Programme in Marine Science.

However, animal home ranges often change with ontogeny, and quantifying the associated temporal and spatial changes is particularly challenging for mobile marine species. Here, we investigated how the space use of a top predatory reef-associated fish (giant trevally Caranx ignobilis) scales with body size. Fish were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively tracked for > 3 yr at a tropical island and atoll in the Republic of Seychelles. A sheltered atoll environment was critical for juvenile fish (< 60 cm fork length, FL) that exhibited a shift in home range location and area as they matured into adults. Small (60-100 cm FL) and large (>100 cm FL) adult fish appeared to favour shallow coral reefs and associated reef drop offs whilst sharing a similar core home range location. Large adult fish utilized a greater diversity of habitat types and had significantly (p < 0.05) greater annual dispersal distances (mean = 35.29 km, max = 91.32 km) than small adults (mean = 13.72 km, max = 21.55 km). Additionally, the home range of large adults (mean = 209.74 km(2)) was significantly (p < 0.05) larger than that of juveniles (mean = 38.73 km(2)) and small adults (77.32 km(2)) and there was a significant (p = 0.02) relationship between fish length and home range size. Furthermore, tagged fish took up to 34 mo (mean = 18.54 mo) to utilize the full extent of their home range. The habitat shift and expansion in home range size throughout ontogeny should be taken into account when designing effective spatial management plans for C. ignobilis.","[Daly, R.; Mann, B.

Many large MPAs are, however, impacted by illegal fishing activity conducted by unlicensed vessels. While enforcement of these reserves is often expensive, it would likely benefit from the integration of ecological data on the mobile animals they are designed to protect. Consequently, shark populations in some protected areas continue to decline, as they remain a prime target for illegal fishers. To understand shark movements and their vulnerability to illegal fishing, 3 years of acoustic tracking data, from 101 reef-associated sharks, were analysed as movement networks to explore the predictability of movement patterns and identify key movement corridors within the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) MPA. We examined how space use and connectivity overlap with spatially explicit risk of illegal fishing, through data obtained from the management consultancy enforcing the MPA. Using individual-based models, the movement networks of two sympatric shark species were efficiently predicted with distance-decay functions (>95% movements accurately predicted). Model outliers were used to highlight the locations with unexpectedly high movement rates where MPA enforcement patrols might most efficiently mitigate predator removal. Activity space estimates and network metrics illustrate that silvertip sharks were more dynamic, less resident and link larger components of the MPA than grey reef sharks. However, we show that this behaviour potentially enhances their exposure to illegal fishing activity. Synthesis and applications. Marine protected area (MPA) enforcement strategies are often limited by resources. The British Indian Ocean Territory MPA, one of the world's largest 'no take' MPAs, has a single patrol vessel to enforce 640,000 km(2)of open ocean, atoll and reef ecosystems. We argue that to optimize the patrol vessel search strategy and thus enhance their protective capacity, ecological data on the space use and movements of desirable species, such as large-bodied reef predators, must be incorporated into management plans. Here, we use electronic tracking data to evaluate how shark movement dynamics influence species mortality trajectories in exploited reef ecosystems. In doing so we discuss how network analyses of such data might be applied for protected area enforcement.","[Jacoby, David M.

Owing to global declines, the species is listed as Vulnerable under the International Union of Conservation for Nature Red List. Samples from 152C. albimarginatus were collected from three locations: Papua New Guinea (PNG), east Australia and Seychelles. Samples were analysed using mitochondrial, microsatellite and double-digest restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) generated single nucleotide polymorphism markers. As expected across a vast oceanic expanse, no gene flow was identified between south-west Pacific locations and Seychelles for any marker (population differentiation measured using Phi(ST) values 0.92-0.98, F-ST values 0.036-0.059). Mitochondrial DNA indicated significant population structuring between PNG and east Australia (Phi(ST)=0.102), but nuclear markers suggested connectivity between these geographically close regions (F-ST=0.000-0.001). In combination with known telemetry movements for C. albimarginatus, our results suggest stepping-stone patterns of movement between regions is likely driven by reproductive requirements. The use of three distinct marker types in this study has facilitated a powerful genetic description of the population connectivity of C. albimarginatus between the three sampled regions. Importantly, the connectivity described between PNG and east Australia should be used as a guide for managing the south-west Pacific stock of C. albimarginatus.","[Green, M. E.; Appleyard, S.

Tiger sharks exhibited two broad patterns of behavior. Some individuals were detected at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) year round, whereas others visited FFS atoll in summer to forage on fledging albatross, then swam thousands of kilometers along the Hawaiian chain, or out into open ocean to the North Pacific transition zone chlorophyll front, before returning to FFS in subsequent years. These patterns suggest tiger sharks may use cognitive maps to navigate between distant foraging areas. Different patterns of spatial behavior may arise because cognitive maps are built up through individual exploration, and each tiger shark learns a unique combination of foraging sites. Galapagos shark detections were all associated with FFS, suggesting these sharks may be more resident around oceanic islands. Both Galapagos and tiger sharks primarily used the mixed layer (< 100 m depth) and made occasional deeper dives through the thermocline down to 680 m. Results show reef-associated sharks utilize a wide variety of habitats ranging from shallow atoll lagoons to deep reefs and open ocean and may provide important trophic links between these habitats.","[Meyer, Carl G.; Papastamatiou, Yannis P.; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",National Marine Sanctuary Program [MOA 2005-008/6882],National Marine Sanctuary Program,"We thank the crew of the NOAA ship Hi'ialakai especially coxswains S.

Accurate site descriptions associated with these aggregations are essential for the conservation of R. typus, an Endangered species. Although aggregations have become valuable hubs for research, most site descriptions rely heavily on sightings data. In the present study, visual census, passive acoustic monitoring, and long range satellite telemetry were combined to track the movements of R. typus from Shib Habil, a reef-associated aggregation site in the Red Sea. An array of 63 receiver stations was used to record the presence of 84 acoustically tagged sharks (35 females, 37 males, 12 undetermined) from April 2010 to May 2016. Over the same period, identification photos were taken for 76 of these tagged individuals and 38 were fitted with satellite transmitters. In total of 37,461 acoustic detections, 210 visual encounters, and 33 satellite tracks were analyzed to describe the sharks' movement ecology. The results demonstrate that the aggregation is seasonal, mostly concentrated on the exposed side of Shib Habil, and seems to attract sharks of both sexes in roughly equal numbers. The combined methodologies also tracked 15 interannual homing-migrations, demonstrating that many sharks leave the area before returning in later years. When compared to acoustic studies from other aggregations, these results demonstrate that R. typus exhibits diverse, site-specific ecologies across its range. Sightings-independent data from acoustic telemetry and other sources are an effective means of validating more common visual surveys.","[Cochran, Jesse E.

Because of the predictability of annual aggregations, giant sea bass (GSB) were fished throughout the twentieth century until they were nearly extirpated from southern California and Baja California, Mexico. To assess population recovery, acoustic telemetry was used to quantify spatiotemporal rhythmicity of GSB aggregations at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. Thirty-two individuals were tracked for 498 days over two consecutive spawning seasons in 2017-2018 and visual surveys were conducted monthly to estimate aggregation sizes. Aggregation behavior was documented from June-October and spawning most likely occurred at a pinnacle promontory from July-September. GSB exhibited residency to specific sites throughout the year and individuals showed fidelity to suspected spawning aggregation sites during the summer months. Ten (31%) GSB were detected at Santa Catalina Island year-round and 11 (34%) exhibited suspected annual spawning site fidelity. Four individuals (12%) were documented leaving the island during late fall/winter 2017 and returning in spring/early summer 2018, indicating partial seasonal migration and year-round fidelity to specific sites at Santa Catalina Island. This study provides a baseline of spatiotemporal movements and behavioral patterns that can be used to improve our understanding of GSB and enhance management for these and other large-bodied predatory fish species.","[Clevenstine, Alyssa J.; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Clevenstine, AJ (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",aclevenstine@gmail.com,,"Clevenstine, Alyssa/0000-0003-2449-3447",AltaSea; Marine Conservation Research Institute of the Aquarium of the Pacific; PEO International; PEO Chapter GA; PEO Chapter JX; California State University COAST Graduate Student Research Awards; Sothern California Academy of Sciences Student Research Grant; Southern California Tuna Club Graduate Student Research Grants; Donald Reish Student Research Grant; University of Southern California Wrigley Graduate Fellowship; International Women's Fishing Association Scholarship; California State University Long Beach Summer Student Research Assistantship,AltaSea; Marine Conservation Research Institute of the Aquarium of the Pacific; PEO International; PEO Chapter GA; PEO Chapter JX; California State University COAST Graduate Student Research Awards; Sothern California Academy of Sciences Student Research Grant; Southern California Tuna Club Graduate Student Research Grants; Donald Reish Student Research Grant; University of Southern California Wrigley Graduate Fellowship; International Women's Fishing Association Scholarship; California State University Long Beach Summer Student Research Assistantship,"This work was supported by AltaSea, the Marine Conservation Research Institute of the Aquarium of the Pacific, PEO International, PEO Chapters GA and JX, California State University COAST Graduate Student Research Awards, Sothern California Academy of Sciences Student Research Grant, Southern California Tuna Club Graduate Student Research Grants, Donald Reish Student Research Grant, University of Southern California Wrigley Graduate Fellowship, International Women's Fishing Association Scholarship, and the California State University Long Beach Summer Student Research Assistantship.",,67,11,12,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Although both species exhibited partial site fidelity in that they were most likely to be detected near the area of original capture both species also moved widely throughout the 10 by 30 km atoll. One Caribbean reef shark was detected by a monitor at Lighthouse Reef, km from Glover's Reef across deep (> 400m) open water. The mean minimum linear dispersal (MLD) was 10.5 km for Caribbean reef sharks and 7.7 km for nurse sharks, with man individuals travelling more than the 10 km width of the no-take conservation zone of the marine reserve. Although most sharks were tagged within the, conservation, zone, individuals were detected outside this part of GRMR on average 48 days out of the 150 days of observations. However, of 7 nurse sharks tagged near the center of the conservation zone, 4 were never detected outside of this part of the reserve. In general, this study suggests that effective consevation of these large roving predators requires an ecosystem-based management approach including a zoned management plan, similar to that used at GRMR, in which a fairly large no-take reserve, incorporating diverse habitats and the connections between them as surrounded by a larger area in which fishing is regulated.","Nova SE Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Oceanog Ctr, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; Univ Miami, Pew Inst Ocean Sci, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",Nova Southeastern University; University of Miami,"Nova SE Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Oceanog Ctr, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.",,"Shivji, Mahmood/G-4080-2013",,,,,,43,129,148,1,70,MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOC INC,COLUMBIA,"5565 STERRETT PLACE, STE 108, COLUMBIA, MD 21044 USA",0025-3324,1948-1209,,MAR TECHNOL SOC J,Mar.

Hawksbill turtles Eretmo-chelys imbricata are considered a key species in coral reef-associated communities, owing to their specific foraging preferences, yet new information is still revealing details of the spatial and temporal aspects of habitat use. We used passive acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of 18 juvenile hawksbills (minimum curved carapace length: 32.0-59.7 cm, mean +/- SD = 43.9 +/- 6.7 cm) at a developmental foraging site in a Mesoamerican barrier reef, Lighthouse Reef Atoll in Belize (tracking duration 10-1414 d, mean +/- SD = 570 +/- 484 d). Although specific home ranges were difficult to quantify, several turtles showed high site fidelity over timescales of months to years, with occasional wide-ranging use of the atoll. Diel variation in the number of detections received strongly suggest nocturnal resting. Long-term tracking data reveal 3 degrees of site fidelity across the atoll, based on the number of detection days near individual stations: high residency(n = 4 turtles), equential residency (n = 5), and transient behavior (n = 4). These variations in movement raise questions about the differentiation of foraging habitats and degree of individual specialization within this population, as well as the influences of microhabitats and human disturbance.","[Chevis, Megan G.; Godley, Brendan J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England; [Chevis, Megan G.; Lewis, Julie Jackson; Graham, Rachel T.] MarAlliance, 32 Coconut Dr,POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize; [Lewis, James P.] Amphibian Survival Alliance, Int Conservat House,7078 Airlie Rd, Warrenton, VA 20187 USA; [Scales, Kylie L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Scales, Kylie L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Ctr, Environm Res Div, 99 Pacific St,Suite 255A, Monterey, CA 93950 USA",University of Exeter; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Graham, RT (corresponding author), MarAlliance, 32 Coconut Dr,POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize.",rachel@maralliance.org,"godley, brendan/A-6139-2009; Scales, Kylie/L-9318-2018","godley, brendan/0000-0003-3845-0034; Chevis, Megan/0000-0002-5996-693X; Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956",MarAlliance; Summit Foundation; British Chelonia Group; Wildlife Conservation Society; Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation,MarAlliance; Summit Foundation; British Chelonia Group; Wildlife Conservation Society; Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation,"Support was provided by MarAlliance, The Summit Foundation, British Chelonia Group, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation.

However, conservation outcomes of MPAs for mobile and long-lived predators such as sharks are highly variable. Here, we use empirical animal tracking data from 459 individual sharks and baited remote underwater video surveys undertaken in 36 countries to construct an empirically supported individual-based model that estimates the conservation effectiveness of MPAs for five species of coral reef-associated sharks (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus perezi, and Ginglymostoma cirratum). We demonstrate how species-specific individual movement traits can contribute to fishing mortality of sharks found within MPAs as they move outside to adjacent fishing grounds. We discovered that the world's officially recorded coral reef-based managed areas (with a median width of 9.4 km) would need to be enforced as strict no-take MPAs and up to 5 times larger to expect protection of the majority of individuals of the five investigated reef shark species. The magnitude of this effect depended on local abundances and fishing pressure, with MPAs required to be 1.6-2.6 times larger to protect the same number of Atlantic and Caribbean species, which occur at lower abundances than similar species in the western Pacific. Furthermore, our model was used to quantify partially substantial reductions (>50%) in fishing mortality resulting from small increases in MPA size, allowing us to bridge a critical gap between traditional conservation planning and fisheries management. Overall, our results highlight the challenge of relying on abundance data alone to ensure that estimates of shark conservation impacts of MPAs follow the precautionary approach.","[Dwyer, Ross G.; Krueck, Nils C.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dwyer, Ross G.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Dwyer, Ross G.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Krueck, Nils C.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Udyawer, Vinay] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Arafura Timor Res Facil, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia; [Udyawer, Vinay] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Chapman, Demian] Florida Int Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 151st St, North Miami, FL USA; [Pratt, Harold L., Jr.] Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL USA; [Pratt, Harold L., Jr.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, 1 Cent Wharf, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Garla, Ricardo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot & Zool, Ave Senador Salgado Filho, BR-59064741 Natal, RN, Brazil",University of Queensland; James Cook University; James Cook University; University of Tasmania; Australian Institute of Marine Science; Charles Darwin University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,"Dwyer, RG; Krueck, NC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;Dwyer, RG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Dwyer, RG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Krueck, NC (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",ross.dwyer@uq.edu.au; nils.krueck@utas.edu.au,"Udyawer, Vinay/L-9432-2019; Dwyer, Ross/IQR-5509-2023; Pratt, Harold/AAK-9544-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Garla, Ricardo/A-2990-2014","Garla, Ricardo/0000-0002-0827-225X; Dwyer, Ross/0000-0003-1136-5489; Udyawer, Vinay/0000-0001-5812-0740",Shark Conservation Fund; Paul G.

This study integrates acoustic telemetry and a GIs to quantify movement patterns of one such species, the ocean whitefish (Caulolatilus princeps) in a marine protected area. Seventeen ocean whitefish were tagged and actively tracked over multiple 24-h periods to measure fine-scale movement patterns. Home ranges based on 95% kernel utilization distributions averaged 20,439 +/- 28,492 (+/- S.D.) m(2). Fish were active during the day, foraging over sand habitat at depths averaging 21 +/- 8 m, but were inactive at night, taking refuge near rocky reefs at depths averaging 15 +/- 7 m. Seventeen additional fish were tagged with coded acoustic transmitters and passively tracked using automated underwater acoustic receivers for up to I year. Approximately 75% of these fish exhibited long-term (I year) fidelity to home ranges in the study area. Results suggest that MPAs can be an effective means of protecting populations of ocean whitefish and based on their habitat associations, ocean whitefish can be managed separately from other reef associated groundfishes.

Specifically, we provide an overview of the ways in which acoustic telemetry can be used to inform issues central to the ecology, conservation, and management of exploited and/or imperiled fish species. Despite great strides in this area in recent years, there are comparatively few examples where data have been applied directly to influence fisheries management and policy. We review the literature on this issue, identify the strengths and weaknesses of work done to date, and highlight knowledge gaps and difficulties in applying empirical fish telemetry studies to fisheries policy and practice. We then highlight the key areas of management and policy addressed, as well as the challenges that needed to be overcome to do this. We conclude with a set of recommendations about how researchers can, in consultation with stock assessment scientists and managers, formulate testable scientific questions to address and design future studies to generate data that can be used in a meaningful way by fisheries management and conservation practitioners. We also urge the involvement of relevant stakeholders (managers, fishers, conservation societies, etc.) early on in the process (i.e., in the co-creation of research projects), so that all priority questions and issues can be addressed effectively.","[Crossin, Glenn T.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B4H 4R2, Canada; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Holbrook, Christopher M.] US Geol Survey, Great Lakes Sci Ctr, Hammond Bay Biol Stn, 11188 Ray Rd, Millersburg, MI 49759 USA; [Hussey, Nigel E.; Raby, Graham D.] Univ Windsor, Dept Biol, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, 7922 North West 71st St, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Nguyen, Vivian M.; Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Nguyen, Vivian M.; Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Dalhousie University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; University of Windsor; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Carleton University; Carleton University,"Crossin, GT (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, 1355 Oxford St, Halifax, NS B4H 4R2, Canada.",gtc@dal.ca,"Nguyen, Vivian/AAO-8682-2020; Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/JOZ-3798-2023; Hussey, Nigel/F-9699-2015; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Crossin, Glenn/0000-0003-1080-1189; Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/0000-0001-5146-3257; Nguyen, Vivian/0000-0002-8666-8137; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Ocean Tracking Network - Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Ocean Tracking Network - Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank the authors who contributed papers for the special issues in acoustic telemetry as well as the editorial team from Ecological Applications and the many referees that evaluated the contributions.

Among MPAs, a large percentage has been created with the implicit goal of protecting shark populations, including 17 shark sanctuaries which fully protect sharks throughout their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas represents a long-term MPA for sharks, following the banning of commercial longlining in 1993 and subsequent designation as a shark sanctuary in 2011. Little is known, however, about the longterm behavior and space use of sharks within this protected area, particularly among reef-associated sharks for which the sanctuary presumably offers the most benefit. We used acoustic telemetry to advance our understanding of the ecology of such sharks, namely Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), over two discrete islands (New Providence and Great Exuma) varying in human activity level, over 2 years. We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space. Tiger sharks were associated with shallow seagrass habitats where available, but frequently transited between and connected different habitat types. Our data support the notion that large MPAs afford greater degrees of protection for highly resident species such as Caribbean reef sharks, shark, acoustic telemetry, marine protected area, MPA, seagrass, coral reef, Bahamas, Caribbean","[Gallagher, Austin J.; Shipley, Oliver N.; Kattan, Sami; Shea, Brendan D.] Waves, Herndon, VA 20172 USA; [Shipley, Oliver N.; Frisk, Michael G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Bergmann, Maurits P.

Site fidelity was high amongst these fish, with home ranges not exceeding 650 m in diameter or 139 600 m(2) in area. Eleven other snapper received tags by feeding and were tracked for periods of up to 2.5 d. Site fidelity was also high for these fish, with standardised estimates of home-range size not differing between the 2 groups. Home ranges overlapped considerably, indicating that the fish were not territorial. The location of the home ranges generally remained stable throughout the entire tracking period, although 1 fish relocated its home range by similar to220 m. A new method of home-range estimation was developed, which matched the level of detail provided by the RAPT system, to directly estimate the time spent in an area.

The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. MethodsBull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N=86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. ResultsA total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Main conclusionsExpansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators.","[Graham, Fiona; Rynne, Patrick; Estevanez, Maria; Luo, Jiangang; Ault, Jerald S.; Hammerschlag, Neil] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Hammerschlag, Neil] Univ Miami, Leonard & Jayne Abess Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Policy, POB 248203, Coral Gables, FL 33146 USA",University of Miami; University of Miami,"Hammerschlag, N (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nhammerschlag@rsmas.miami.edu,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007",Batchelor Foundation; Disney Conservation Fund; Wells Fargo; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; West Coast Inland Navigation District,Batchelor Foundation; Disney Conservation Fund; Wells Fargo; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; West Coast Inland Navigation District,"This research benefitted greatly from the dedicated contributions of all the University of Miami's Shark Research and Conservation Programme team leaders and interns who assisted in the capture and tagging expeditions.

Therefore, understanding how the behaviour and spatial ecology of a species differs across reef habitats is essential for developing sound conservation approaches. The present study examined the residency, movement and activity space of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers covering 17 semi-isolated coral reefs across 150 km was used to monitor shark movements. Forty C. amblyrhynchos were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored from 251 to 821 days. Most sharks were detected on a single reef; however, some individuals (4 females; 10 males) moved to up to five reefs. Residency index ranged from 0.02 to 1.0, with a mean +/- A SD of 0.78 +/- A 0.26. Mixed-effect models showed that weekly and monthly residency was mainly influenced by shark size, with little or no effect of environmental parameters. Although C. amblyrhynchos were present year-round, juvenile sharks had lower residency to their tagging reef than adults. In addition, mature females were detected less between November and mid-February, which coincides with reported parturition in the central GBR. Long-term monitoring data revealed that C. amblyrhynchos exhibited high residency to their tagging reef, and therefore, even in systems with semi-isolated reefs such as the GBR, this species may benefit from spatial management approaches at the reef level. However, behavioural differences between sexes and life-stages of C. amblyrhynchos reported in this study suggest marine reserves may provide lower protection relative to more remote and isolated coral reefs.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

We used a multi-tissue stable isotope approach to investigate the trophic ecology of common reef predators in the central Great Barrier Reef of Australia. Our study revealed significant trophic separation among reef predators, especially when considering isotopic data from muscle, a slower turnover tissue. Based on muscle data, the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, a large wide-ranging coastal species, occupied a higher trophic position and had a larger isotopic niche breadth (19.1 parts per thousand(2)) relative to smaller predators, including resident sharks (4.5 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand(2)) and large-bodied teleosts (4.4 +/- 1.8 parts per thousand(2)). Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus commerson and bull sharks had the largest unique total areas of isotopic niche space (expressed as a percentage) that did not overlap with any other species, 95% and 69.4 %, respectively, which means they had lower isotopic overlap. In general, faster turnover tissues such as whole blood and plasma showed higher isotopic overlap and smaller niche breadth for all reef predators. These results suggest that bull sharks use similar prey resources to large and small resident predators, at least during short periods. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating dietary changes in faster-turnover tissues of reef predators, particularly large wide-ranging species, which may have key roles in coral reef food webs through direct predation and competition.","[Espinoza, Mario; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica; [Matley, Jordan; Fisk, Aaron T.] Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON N9B 304, Canada; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; Universidad Costa Rica; Universidad Costa Rica; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica.",mario.espinoza_m@ucr.ac.cr,"Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Espinoza, Mario/AAV-3460-2020","Matley, Jordan/0000-0003-4286-597X",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub) [6.1]; Australian Research Council [FT100101004]; Canada Research Chair program; PADI Foundation; Australian Endeavour Scholarship; AIMS@JCU Scholarship; Australian Research Council [FT100101004] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,"Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub)(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Canada Research Chair program(Canada Research Chairs); PADI Foundation; Australian Endeavour Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); AIMS@JCU Scholarship; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This research was conducted under research permits from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (G10/33754.1 and G10/33758.1) and Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries permit number 144482.

Thirty percent of the fish tagged were not detected after the first 6 d following release and were assumed to have died or to have immediately emigrated away from platforms. Degrees of site fidelity varied widely among individuals, among species, and between platforms. Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range 5-15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish. Observed movements of fishes between platforms and natural reef habitat indicate that they can navigate between these habitats and that platform habitat, despite having higher densities of conspecifics, may be of higher quality to some individuals than natural reefs.","[Lowe, Christopher G.; Anthony, Kim M.; Jarvis, Erica T.; Bellquist, Lyall F.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Love, Milton S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lowe, CG (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",clowe@csulb.edu,"Mason, Erica/AAT-1377-2021","Mason, Erica/0000-0003-3366-157X; Bellquist, Lyall/0000-0003-1247-0483",Minerals Management Service [1435-01-04-CA-34196 OCS/MMS 2007-006]; California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program,Minerals Management Service; California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program,"We thank A.

The bronze whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus) is a large-bodied, slow-growing shark species that is widely distributed throughout temperate Australian waters. Currently, habitat use, spatio-temporal presence and fine-scale movement information is unknown for Southern Australian waters. This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of occurrence, habitat use, and residency of bronze whalers in Gulf St. Vincent, South Australia. Forty-seven predominately small juvenile bronze whalers (83% of tagged sharks<150cm TL) were tagged with acoustic transmitters from 2009 to 2014 and monitored for periods of up to 55months (range 516-1634days; mean +/- standard error 825 +/- 47). The seasonal presence of bronze whalers peaked in spring-early autumn (September-April). Site fidelity was high, with 77% of tagged sharks detected over multiple years and 36% detected over 3years. Low estimates of mean residency index (R-i=0.05 +/- 0.01) indicated that time spent within the array was limited. Shark occurrence was driven by a combination of factors, which included water temperature, season, moon illumination, and wind speed. Manly-Chesson's Electivity Index showed bronze whalers exhibited the highest affinity to seagrass (Posidonia spp.), suggesting that this habitat plays an important role in the early life history stages. The slow growth and low productivity of bronze whalers combined with its predictable nearshore occurrence result in this species having an increased susceptibility to anthropogenic threats, which highlights the need for continued monitoring and vulnerability assessments.","[Drew, Michael; Rogers, Paul] South Australia Res & Dev Inst Aquat Sci, Finfish Subprogram, Adelaide, SA 5024, Australia; [Drew, Michael; Lloyd, Matthew; Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Biol Sci, Southern Shark Ecol Grp, Adelaide, SA 5043, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Drew, M (corresponding author), South Australia Res & Dev Inst Aquat Sci, Finfish Subprogram, Adelaide, SA 5024, Australia.;Drew, M (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Biol Sci, Southern Shark Ecol Grp, Adelaide, SA 5043, Australia.",michael.drew@sa.gov.au,,"Huveneers, Charlie/0000-0001-8937-1358; Drew, Michael/0000-0002-5109-7792",Australian Postgraduate Award; Adelaide & Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board; Neiser Foundation; Nature Foundation of South Australia Inc; Tracking Research for Animal Conservation Society (TRACS); Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy; Super Science Initiative,"Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government); Adelaide & Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board; Neiser Foundation; Nature Foundation of South Australia Inc; Tracking Research for Animal Conservation Society (TRACS); Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Super Science Initiative","This project was jointly funded by the Australian Postgraduate Award to MD, the Adelaide & Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board, the Neiser Foundation, the Nature Foundation of South Australia Inc, and the Tracking Research for Animal Conservation Society (TRACS).

For instance, reef shark species are thought to benefit from marine protected area networks, even though their movement behaviour remains poorly characterized. Poor understanding of species' movements implies that the benefits of MPA networks for species' populations are still widely unknown. To understand the consequences of movement behaviour for protection, we modelled movements of three reef shark species' (Carcharhinus albimarginatus,C. amblyrhynchosandC. leucas) with distinct levels of reef association using real passive-acoustic telemetry data. The model simulates if individuals are protected or unprotected by their movements in a system of reef patches in a network of MPAs. Model parameters that control individuals' movements were estimated from acoustic telemetry data. To estimate benefits for species we monitored longevity and time spent in protected habitats across all scenarios of reef protection, fishing intensity (11 values for each) and protection of high or low suitability reefs (a reef-dependent factor that attracts sharks to reside in it) for populations of 1,000 individuals per species. The time individuals spent in protected reefs increased linearly with protection until it levelled off after 50%-80% of reefs protected (78%C. amblyrhynchos, 72%C. albimarginatusand 52% C. leucas, at 100% protection). Individuals' life span decreased exponentially with fishing intensity. Reef protection only mildly counteracted life span lost to fishing. Protecting highly suitable reefs increased time spent in protected reefs, optimal protection was reached at a lower number of reefs protected, and life expectancy was higher with protection of highly suitable reefs. Synthesis and applications. Our framework can be applied to many studies using passive-acoustic telemetry to track animal movements. Protected area networks benefit species highly attached to protected sites. To increase benefits of marine protected area networks for all species (with low and high degrees of reef attachment) we need to understand the use of reef-adjacent areas, dispersal routes and characterize reef suitability for multiple species.","[Martin, Gerardo] Imperial Coll London St Marys, Fac Med, MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol CIMAR, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Heupel, Michelle] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Imperial College London; Universidad Costa Rica; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Martín, G (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London St Marys, Fac Med, MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England.",gerardommc@gmail.com,"; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Martin, Gerardo/0000-0003-3608-5328; Simpfendorfer, Colin/0000-0002-0295-2238",Natural Environmental Research Program [6.1],Natural Environmental Research Program,"Natural Environmental Research Program, Grant/Award Number: 6.1",,71,17,17,9,64,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

Transmitter-tagged sharks were monitored from November 2012 to July 2019. Residency comparisons were based on the percentage of days that an individual was present in the study area for each month. Sandbar Sharks had greater residencies in fall than spring and winter, Bull Sharks had greater residencies in summer, and Nurse Sharks had greater residencies in the fall. No seasonal patterns were detected for Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks, but one individual returned to the study area in all 5 years that the transmitter was active. One Sandbar Shark and one Nurse Shark had long-term preferences (>3 years) for specific sites. Long-distance migrations (n = 7) away from the artificial reef area in the northern Gulf of Mexico were observed for three Sandbar Sharks (588, 589, and 1,894 km), two Bull Sharks (927 and 968 km), and two Nurse Sharks (903 and 943 km), with six of these migrating sharks returning to their tagging areas. Specifically, two Bull Sharks and two Nurse Sharks made winter migrations to the southern end of Florida (Florida Keys), and two Sandbar Sharks migrated to the middle of the west coast of Florida. A third Sandbar Shark made the longest distance migration and moved out of the Gulf of Mexico, into the Atlantic Ocean, and up to the South Carolina coast. Importantly, this Sandbar Shark returned to the same artificial reef where it was tagged and released in the northern Gulf of Mexico after its 3,788-km round trip migration. These long-distance migrations and subsequent homing behaviors, coupled with local residencies, indicate that the artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico may have significance extending well beyond the localized areas of reef deployment.","[Altobelli, Ashley N.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Szedlmayer, ST (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA.",szedlst@auburn.edu,,,Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Sportfish Restoration Fund,Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Sportfish Restoration Fund,"We thank R.

This study used the horizontal movements of acoustically tagged Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) to examine their use of coastal space around the Cayman Islands between 2009 and 2019. A total of 39 (59.1%) tagged sharks (male = 22, female = 17, immature = 18, mature = 21) were detected on the islands wide network of acoustic receivers. The detection data were used to calculate values of Residency Index (RI), Site-Fidelity Index (SFI) and minimum linear displacement (MLD), as well as for network analysis of individual shark movements to test for differences between demographics, seasons, and diel periods. Sharks were detected for up to 1,598 days post-tagging and some individuals showed resident behaviour but the majority of tagged individuals appear to have been one-off or only occasional transient visitors to the area. Generally, individuals showed strong site-fidelity to different areas displaying linear home ranges of < 20 km. The evidence indicates that there was no pattern of diel behaviour. Tagged sharks generally showed increased movements within and between islands during the summer (April-September), which may be related to breeding activity. Some individuals even made occasional excursions across 110 km of open water > 2,000 m deep between Grand Cayman and Little Cayman. One mature female shark showed a displacement of 148.21 km, the greatest distance reported for this species. The data shows that the distances over which some sharks moved, greatly exceeded the extent of any one of the islands' marine protected areas indicating that this species may be more mobile and dispersive than previously thought.

Yet, MPAs are often designed without sufficient ecological knowledge of the species they are intended to protect. This is particularly relevant to large and wide-ranging marine predators including many elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), for which region-specific space-use information is limited. Further, uncertainty remains in how to integrate movement datasets with systematic conservation planning frameworks to meet explicit conservation objectives. We addressed these knowledge gaps by combining movement models, constructed from passive acoustic telemetry data for eight elasmobranch species, and systematic conservation planning to investigate the design and adequacy of MPAs in Bimini, The Bahamas. Currently, there is a proposal for a no-take MPA in North Bimini (NBMPA), although it is unclear how this MPA would benefit elasmobranch communities if or when imple-mented. Our results show that although the NBMPA would contribute to elasmobranch conservation, the sup-plementation with an additional MPA southwest of Bimini would be necessary to protect important habitats for multiple elasmobranch species. This southwestern area was highlighted as a conservation priority area of both permanent MPA designs as well as seasonal time-area closures, regardless of NBMPA implementation status and conservation targets considered in this study. Our integrative approach also demonstrates its ability to optimize MPA designs for marine predator communities, combining multi-species movement models, constructed from acoustic telemetry datasets that include space-use estimates over multiple years, with MPA optimization tools.","[Bergmann, Maurits P.

Although most marine protected areas (MPAs) were originally established to protect less mobile organisms, protection of shark species from fishing and other impacts is possible if individuals exhibit high residency and site fidelity within the MPA boundaries. For this study, we used a fixed acoustic telemetry array to study the residency, habitat use, and interspecific space use among 4 shark species in Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), an MPA in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. From June 2013 to May 2017, 11 nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum, 6 lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris, 13 Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi, and 6 tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were monitored in the array. Overall, residency was high for all species, with a mean residency index of 0.52 or higher for each species. Network analysis revealed complex inter- and intraspecific spatial associations among individuals. Community detection algorithms showed that G. cirratum and N. brevirostris frequently used the same areas in BIRNM, selecting for shallow sand and seagrass habitats near linear reefs, while G. cuvier and C. perezi had more individualized space use. C. perezi also exhibited ontogenetic shifts, developing individual territories and using deeper water with increasing body size. This work emphasizes the importance of MPA size, placement, and habitat composition when aiming to protect highly mobile species with potentially large home ranges and shifting space use throughout their life histories.","[Casselberry, Grace A.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Finn, John T.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [DeAngelis, Bryan M.] Nature Conservancy, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, St Croix, VI USA; [Lundgren, Ian] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Reg Off, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Nature Conservancy; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries,"Casselberry, GA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gcasselberry@umass.edu,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Casselberry, Grace/0000-0002-7572-7584; Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011",Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14]; New England Aquarium's Marine Conservation Action Fund; Atlantic White Shark Conservancy; National Park Service,Puerto Rico Sea Grant; New England Aquarium's Marine Conservation Action Fund; Atlantic White Shark Conservancy; National Park Service,"This project was funded in part by Puerto Rico Sea Grant (R-101-2-14), The New England Aquarium's Marine Conservation Action Fund, The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, and The National Park Service.

However, there remains much debate about how effective MPAs are, especially in terms of their ability to protect mobile marine species such as teleost and chondrichthyan fishes. We used satellite and acoustic tags to assess the ability of a large oceanic MPA, the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA (BIOT MPA), to protect seven species of pelagic and reef-associated teleost and chondrichthyan fishes. We satellite-tagged 26 animals from six species (Blue Marlin, Reef Mantas, Sailfish, Silky Sharks, Silvertip Sharks, and Yellowfin Tuna), producing 2,735 days of movement data. We also acoustically tagged 121 sharks from two species (Grey Reef and Silvertip Sharks), which were monitored for up to 40 months across a large acoustic receiver array spanning the MPA. We found that the activity spaces of all satellite-tagged animals, including pelagic species, were much smaller than the area of the BIOT MPA, even taking into account errors associated with position estimates. Estimates of space use of acoustically tagged sharks, based on dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMM), were also much smaller than the size of the MPA. However, we found important limitations when using dBBMM and demonstrate its sensitivity to both study duration and array design. We found that Grey Reef Sharks should be monitored for at least 1 year and Silvertip Sharks for 2 years before their activity space can be effectively estimated. We also demonstrate the potentially important role that intraspecific variability in spatial ecology may play in influencing the ability of MPAs to effectively protect populations of mobile species. Overall, our results suggest that, with effective enforcement, MPAs on the scale of the BIOT MPA potentially offer protection to a variety of pelagic and reef species with a range of spatial ecologies. We suggest that animals need to be tagged across seasons, years, and ontogenetic stages, in order to fully characterize their spatial ecology, which is fundamental to developing and implementing effective MPAs to conserve the full life history of target species.","[Carlisle, Aaron B.; Dale, Jonathan J.; Ferretti, Francesco; Chapple, Taylor K.; Schallert, Robert J.; Castleton, Michael; Block, Barbara A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Tickler, David] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Futures Lab, Perth, WA, Australia; [Curnick, David J.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Curnick, David J.] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London, England; [Carlisle, Aaron B.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",Stanford University; University of Western Australia; Zoological Society of London; University of London; University College London; University of Delaware,"Carlisle, AB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.;Carlisle, AB (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.",carlisle@udel.edu,"Ferretti, Francesco/AAR-2545-2020; Tickler, David/KIC-7386-2024","Schallert, Robert/0000-0002-3584-2668; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0001-9510-3552; Carlisle, Aaron/0000-0003-0796-6564; Curnick, David/0000-0002-3093-1282",Bertarelli Foundation,Bertarelli Foundation,Funding for this project was provided by the Bertarelli Foundation and contributed to the Bertarelli Programme in Marine Science.,,68,50,51,2,32,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.
