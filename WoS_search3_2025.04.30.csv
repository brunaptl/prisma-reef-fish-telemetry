In this study, we selected 3 species, Sparisoma viride (Scaridae), Acanthurus chirurgus (Acanthuridae), and Lutjanus apodus (Lutjanidae), to quantify their home ranges, evaluate their site fidelity, and identify movement patterns in Martinique (14 degrees 36' N, 61 degrees 32' W). Two complementary tagging methods (external Floy tags and acoustic telemetry) were utilised to monitor movement patterns on different spatial scales from November 2009 to November 2011. We tagged 673 A. chirurgus, 131 L. apodus, and 217 S. viride with Floy tags and 30 A. chirurgus, 47 L. apodus, and 37 S. viride with acoustic tags. The results revealed that several individuals maintained a small preferential site for several months to over a year. Other individuals were able to move long distances (< 9 km) outside the MPA over a short period (< 3 d) and never returned to the MPA. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tagging methods and long-term observations to improve the monitoring of fish movement relative to MPA design and effectiveness. Despite the fragmented habitat in the studied MPA, the results highlight that small MPAs (9.56 km(2)) could protect the 3 studied species. This study also demonstrated that natural barriers (large areas of silt and sand) were crossed by some individuals. Our findings provide relevant information on these species that should be utilised to better inform MPA design and decision-making processes, management, and overall MPA effectiveness.","[Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Rousseau, Yann] CNRS Guyane, USR3456, Cayenne 97300, French Guiana; [Legrand, Helene] DEAL, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU),"Garcia, J (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol Hidrol, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",jessicagarcia.mpa@gmail.com,"Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009",,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,"Financial support for this study was provided by Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.

While many aspects of lionfish ecology in their invaded range have been examined, there is a paucity of information on movements of lionfish, particularly adults. We surgically implanted ultrasonic transmitters into 25 lionfish at a natural hard bottom area off North Carolina (USA) in December 2008 and February 2009, and used an array of remote underwater receivers to monitor movements in the study area for up to 6 mo. We also affixed a control transmitter in the study area to assess changes in transmitter detection rate as a function of multiple variables, and used a generalized additive model to show that the control transmitter detection rate declined with time, increasing water temperature, and increasing wave period. Despite variable detection probabilities, we found that telemetered lionfish remaining in the study area displayed high site fidelity to areas no broader than 400 m in diameter; daily movements were nearly always < 150 m. By estimating variable detection rates of transmitters and lionfish movements, we provided information that can be useful in understanding the spatial scale of lionfish impact and developing management or mitigation strategies for this invasive species.","[Bacheler, Nathan M.; Munoz, Roldan C.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Whitfield, Paula E.; Harrison, Brett B.; Buckel, Christine A.] NOAA, Ctr Coastal Fisheries & Habitat Res, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Harms, Craig A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA; [Harms, Craig A.] N Carolina State Univ, Ctr Marine Sci & Technol, Morehead City, NC 28557 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; North Carolina State University; North Carolina State University,"Bacheler, NM (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.",nate.bacheler@noaa.gov,,,,,,,69,31,34,0,83,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Geomagnetic cues are thought to guide long-range navigation, while visual or olfactory cues allow animals to pinpoint precise locations, but the complete behavioral sequence is not yet understood. Terra Ceia Bay is a primary nursery area for blacktip sharks, Carcharhinus limbatus, on southwestern Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. Young-of-theyear animals show strong fidelity to a specific home range in the northeastern end of the bay and rapidly return when displaced. Older juveniles demonstrate annual philopatry for the first few years, migrating as far south as the Florida Keys each fall, then returning to Terra Ceia Bay each spring. To examine the sensory cues used in homing, we captured neonate (53 weeks old) blacktip sharks from within their home range, fitted them with acoustic tags, and translocated them to sites 8km away in adjacent Tampa Bay and released them. Intact animals returned to their home range, within 34 h on average, and remained there. With olfaction blocked, fewer animals returned to their home range and they took longer to do so, 130 h on average. However, they did not remain there but instead moved throughout Terra Ceia Bay and in and out of Tampa Bay. Since sharks from both treatments returned at night in tannic and turbid water, vision is likely not playing a major role in navigation by these animals. The animals in this study also returned on incoming or slack tides, suggesting that sharks, like many other fish, may use selective tidal stream transport to conserve energy and aid navigation during migration. Collectively, these results suggest that while other cues, possibly geomagnetic and/or tidal information, might guide sharks over long distances, olfactory cues are required for recognizing their specific home range.","[Gardiner, Jayne M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Gardiner, Jayne M.] New Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Mote Marine Lab, Behav Ecol & Physiol Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Hueter, Robert E.] Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Shark Res, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; State University System of Florida; New College Florida; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium,"Gardiner, JM (corresponding author), Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, 1600 Ken Thompson Pkwy, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.",jgardiner@ncf.edu,,"Gardiner, Jayne/0000-0002-9989-2891",Florida Sea Grant [PD-12-04]; Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship,Florida Sea Grant; Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship,This work was supported by Florida Sea Grant (PD-12-04) and a Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship [to J.M.G.].,,114,24,29,2,128,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness.","[Pittman, Simon J.; Monaco, Mark E.; Kendall, Matthew S.; Poti, Matthew; Clark, Randall D.; Wedding, Lisa M.; Caldow, Chris] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.; Legare, Bryan; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Islands, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Plymouth, Ctr Marine & Coastal Policy Res, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Texas Parks & Wildlife, Dickinson Marine Lab, Dickinson, TX USA; [Wedding, Lisa M.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Woods Inst Environm, Monterey, CA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands; University of Plymouth; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Stanford University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Wedding, Lisa/GRY-3972-2022","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [0814417]; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-31-1-06]; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy [NA09NMF4270068]; NOAA [NA08NOS4260348]; USGS State Partnership Program [07ERAG0078]; EPSCoR; Office Of The Director [0814417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USGS State Partnership Program; EPSCoR; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"SJP, MEM, AMF and LMW were supported by U.S. National Park Service, NOAA Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA) and NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program.

Mortality on coral reefs is intrinsically linked with predation, with most evidence suggesting that predation is highest during crepuscular periods. We tested this hypothesis using passive acoustic telemetry data to determine the time of day of potential mortality events (PMEs) of adult herbivorous reef fishes. A total of 94 fishes were tagged with acoustic transmitters, of which 43 exhibited a PME. Furthermore, we identified five categories of PMEs based on the nature of change in acoustic signal detections from tagged fishes. The majority of PMEs were characterised by an abrupt stop in detections, possibly as a result of a large, mobile predator. Overall, mortality rates were estimated to be approximately 59 % per year using passive acoustic telemetry. The time of day of PMEs suggests that predation was highest during the day and crepuscular periods and lowest at night, offering only partial support for the crepuscular predation hypothesis. Visually oriented, diurnal and crepuscular predators appear to be more important than their nocturnal counterparts in terms of predation on adult reef fishes. By timing PMEs, passive acoustic telemetry may offer an important new tool for investigating the nature of predation on coral reefs.","[Khan, J. A.; Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

Those species responsible for maintaining functional connectivity between habitats are often called mobile links and are regarded as essential elements of resilience. By providing connectivity, they support resilience across spatial scales. Most marine organisms, including fishes, have long-term, biogeographic-scale connectivity through larval movement. Although most reef species are highly site attached after larval settlement, some taxa may also be able to provide rapid, reef-scale connectivity as adults. On coral reefs, the identity of such taxa and the extent of their mobility are not yet known. We use acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of Kyphosus vaigiensis, one of the few reef fishes that feeds on adult brown macroalgae. Unlike other benthic herbivorous fish species, it also exhibits large-scale (> 2 km) movements. Individual K. vaigiensis cover, on average, a 2.5 km length of reef (11 km maximum) each day. These large-scale movements suggest that this species may act as a mobile link, providing functional connectivity, should the need arise, and helping to support functional processes across habitats and spatial scales. An analysis of published studies of home ranges in reef fishes found a consistent relationship between home range size and body length. K. vaigiensis is the sole herbivore to depart significantly from the expected home range-body size relationship, with home range sizes more comparable to exceptionally mobile large pelagic predators rather than other reef herbivores. While the large-scale movements of K. vaigiensis reveal its potential capacity to enhance resilience over large areas, it also emphasizes the potential limitations of small marine reserves to protect some herbivore populations.","[Welsh, J.

While the spatial scales over which these processes occur have been evaluated, the spatial ecology of individual taxa responsible for shaping these processes is almost entirely unknown. This study combined acoustic telemetry and ecological assessments to evaluate the movement patterns and feeding range of a functionally important coral reef fish, Chlorurus microrhinos (f. Labridae). The diurnal home range and feeding areas of C. microrhinos, on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, were quantified using active acoustic telemetry. The average diurnal home range of C. microrhinos was 7,830 m(2) +/- 940 (SE). Core areas of activity (50% kernel utilization distributions) were relatively small, encompassing approximately 22% of an individual's home range (1,690 m(2) +/- 220). Core areas exhibited greater topographic complexity. C. microrhinos may select these areas because of decreased predation risk. Feeding intensities were not homogenous throughout the home range. Core areas were found to have a greater number of feeding scars and are thus exposed to increased bioerosion and algal removal by C. microrhinos. While important in shaping key ecosystem processes, the ecosystem impact of individual C. microrhinos in Pioneer Bay appears to be restricted to small areas within a narrow band along the reef crest.","[Welsh, J.

For all species, we found a clear division between daytime resting areas on the reef and a move towards off-reef areas at night. This was highlighted in the low number of detections at night and the high average transitions between receivers at twilight. Over our study period, average nocturnal space use area (minimum convex polygon) of Plectorhincus gibbosus was 328,089 m2, Plectorhincus lineatus 28,828 m2, and Lutjanus carponotatus 20,369 m2. However, results from a Principal Component Analysis revealed that space use, and movement, varied substantially within species; for 3 of the 4 species the main axis of variation correlated with individual-level behaviour. These large differences in individual space use patterns highlight the need for caution when using species averages when considering ecosystem functions. Overall, our preliminary observations provide a glimpse into the large spatial extent, potential habitat connectivity, and intra and interspecific variation in activity patterns among large nocturnal Indo-Pacific reef fishes. This highlights their potential importance in maintaining ecosystem links between coral reefs and adjacent habitats.","[Collins, William P.; Bellwood, David R.; Morais, Renato A.; Siqueira, Alexandre C.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Morais, Renato A.] Univ Paris Sci & Lettres, CRIOBE, UAR3278, Perpignan, France; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Data Technol Hub, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TropWATER, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Siqueira, Alexandre C.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Sch Sci, Perth, WA, Australia",James Cook University; Universite PSL; James Cook University; James Cook University; Edith Cowan University,"Collins, WP (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",william.collins@my.jcu.edu.au,"Siqueira, Alexandre/AAJ-5987-2020; Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011; Araujo, Renato/AAA-7903-2021","Siqueira, Alexandre C./0000-0001-7970-4024; Waltham, Nathan/0000-0003-0058-773X; Collins, William/0000-0001-8390-6526","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council [CE140100020, FL190100062]; Australian Research Council (DRB); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council (DRB)(Australian Research Council); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","We thank Joanna A.

Movements of ultrasonic tagged reef fish were determined using a calibrated array of omnidirectional hydroacoustic receivers. Average home range sizes were 2.09 +/- 0.39 km(2) (n = 28; total length, TL = 45 to 66 cm) for red grouper Epinephelus morio, 4.17 +/- 1.75 km(2) (n = 5, TL = 48 to 55 cm) for yellowtail snapper Ocyurus chrysurus, 1.44 +/- 1.04 km(2) (n = 2, TL = 57 to 75 cm) for black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci, and 7.64 km(2) (n = 1, TL = 70 cm) for mutton snapper Lutjanus analis. Red grouper and yellowtail snapper moved moderate distances (from 700 to 900 m) with moderate frequency. Observed movements for black groupers were relatively small and infrequent. Mutton snappers appeared to make short, frequent movements. A tracked gray snapper L. griseus made long-distance nocturnal migrations. Several exploited-phase groupers and snappers crossed into and out of reserve boundaries. They were most likely to do so in locations where boundaries were positioned over contiguous coral reef and close to home-range centers. We found that home ranges for red grouper, black grouper, and yellowtail snapper were relatively small in comparison to NTMR area. Our observations suggest that the Dry Tortugas NTMRs may reduce exposure to exploitation for these and other species with limited home ranges, especially where NTMR boundaries do not overlie contiguous reef.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SE Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007","National Park Service CESU [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation [NA17RJ1226, NA08OAR4320892]; ASEE National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship",National Park Service CESU; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); ASEE National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship,"This research was supported by National Park Service CESU contract H5000065040-J5281060165 and NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grants NA17RJ1226 and NA08OAR4320892.

For tropical small-scale fisheries, spatial scales of socially appropriate management are generally small-the median no-take locally managed marine area (LMMA) area throughout the Pacific is less than 1 km(2). This is of particular concern for large coral reef fishes, such as many species of grouper, which migrate to aggregations to spawn. Current data suggest that the catchment areas (i.e. total area from which individuals are drawn) of such aggregations are at spatial scales that preclude effective community-based management with no-take LMMAs. We used acoustic telemetry and tag-returns to examine reproductive migrations and catchment areas of the grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus at a spawning aggregation in Papua New Guinea. Protection of the resultant catchment area of approximately 16 km(2) using a no-take LMMA is socially untenable here and throughout much of the Pacific region. However, we found that spawning migrations were skewed towards shorter distances. Consequently, expanding the current 0.2 km(2) no-take LMMA to 1-2 km(2) would protect approximately 30-50% of the spawning population throughout the non-spawning season. Contrasting with current knowledge, our results demonstrate that species with moderate reproductive migrations can be managed at scales congruous with spatially restricted management tools.","[Waldie, Peter A.; Almany, Glenn R.; Hamilton, Richard J.; Robinson, Jan; Cinner, Joshua E.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Almany, Glenn R.] UPVD, CNRS, EPHE, CRIOBE,USR 3278, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Almany, Glenn R.] Lab Excellence CORAIL, 58 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Sinclair-Taylor, Tane H.; Priest, Mark A.; Berumen, Michael L.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Div Biol & Environm Sci & Engn, Red Sea Res Ctr, Thuwal 23955, Saudi Arabia; [Hamilton, Richard J.] Nature Conservancy, Indopacific Div, South Brisbane, Australia; [Potuku, Tapas] Nature Conservancy, Kavieng Field Off, Kavieng, Papua N Guinea; [Priest, Mark A.] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Priest, Mark A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Rhodes, Kevin L.] MarAlliance, POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize",James Cook University; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Nature Conservancy; Nature Conservancy; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Waldie, PA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",peter.waldie@gmail.com,"Waldie, Peter/J-3896-2019; Cinner, Joshua/E-8966-2011; Sinclair-Taylor, Tane/AAN-5684-2020; Berumen, Michael/F-7745-2011","Waldie, Peter/0000-0002-9153-5638; Hamilton, Richard/0000-0002-0076-4276; Berumen, Michael/0000-0003-2463-2742; Cinner, Joshua/0000-0003-2675-9317; Sinclair-Taylor, Tane/0000-0003-4240-0435","Australian Research Council (ARC), ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Nature Conservancy, Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST); KAUST Red Sea Research Center","Australian Research Council (ARC), ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council); Nature Conservancy, Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology); KAUST Red Sea Research Center(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology)","Funding was provided by the Australian Research Council (ARC), ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, The Nature Conservancy, Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation.

We analysed similar to 2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Friess, Claudia; Bickford, Joel W.; Addis, Dustin T.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Griffin, Lucas P.; Morley, Danielle; Casselberry, Grace A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, South Florida Reg Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Marathon, FL USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA USA; [Hammerschlag, Neil; Rider, Mitchell J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Smukall, Matthew J.; van Zinnicq Bergmann, Maurits P.

Often found in schools, Scarus rivulatus, is an abundant herbivorous species on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, especially on inshore reefs. Recent evidence has highlighted the limited spatial movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools). Each individual may therefore have little impact on the spatial resilience of coral reefs.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

Acoustic telemetry was used to continuously track the movements and activity patterns of 10 harlequin fish (330-620mm total length; 0.5-3kg weight) for a 16-month period at a coastal reef site. Data showed that the harlequin fish is a site-attached, diurnal predator, with a relatively small home range in comparison with other temperate reef fishes from Australia and New Zealand. These characteristics indicate that the harlequin fish is susceptible to localised depletions from fishing, but that it can be protected within no-take marine protected areas and can be detected with appropriate daytime monitoring techniques.

The first experiment was conducted to understand the deployment procedures of an acoustic telemetry system and determine the appropriate deployment of receivers' spacing, while the second experiment was conducted to quantify the site fidelity and habitat use of 11 reef fish in the Fangchenggang artificial reef area in the northern South China Sea, China. The results indicated that the logistic regression model was an effective way to balance the detection probability at different distances between the range test transmitter and receiver, with above 50% detection probability within 240 m and 80% detection probability within 110 m. The residency index, as a quantification of site fidelity, was 0.85 +/- 0.24. The 100% minimum convex polygon, 95% kernel utilization distribution, and 50% kernel utilization distribution, which are the indicators of habitat use, were 34,522.94 +/- 35,548.95, 1,467.52 +/- 1,619.05, and 236.01 +/- 294.59 m(2), respectively. High site fidelity and the small spatial scale of habitat use for reef fish demonstrated that artificial reefs were an effective man-made structure to attract fish. Overall, this study supports the feasibility of the acoustic telemetry system, indicating that it provides a good approach for quantifying the associations between artificial reefs and fish.","[Lyu, Shaoliang; Lauden, Hagai Nsobi; Lin, Kun; Wang, Xuefeng] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Fisheries, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lifei] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chen, Guobao] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, South China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guobao] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Sci Observing & Expt Stn South China Sea Fishery R, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhichao] State Ocean Adm, South China Sea Stand & Metrol Ctr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Guangdong Ocean University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, CAFS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs","Wang, XF (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Fisheries, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China.",xuefeng1999@126.com,"LYU, Shaoliang/S-3773-2016; Wang, Xuefeng/G-1663-2011; Wang, Lifei/AAB-4708-2020","Wang, Lifei/0000-0003-2530-6703; LYU, Shaoliang/0000-0002-8778-1625",,,,,58,0,0,0,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

One of the most important tourism sectors in aquatic environments is scuba diving, an activity considered sustainable given its non-extractive nature and capability of bringing relevant socio-economic benefits to local communities. However, knowledge about its impact on the activity patterns of aquatic animals is still scarce. Here, we used biotelemetry techniques to assess the importance of scuba diving in modulating the activity patterns of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus, Lowe, 1834), a marine predatory fish of high interest for fishing and tourism. We implemented Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on high-resolution acceleration data using a temporal and spatial control while controlling for a set of environmental variables (i.e. photoperiod, time-of-day, moon phase, temperature, wave height, and intensity and direction of marine currents) within a multiple-use marine protected area, and diving tourism hot-spot, of the western Mediterranean Sea. Our results underlined the more decisive influence of environmental-related stressors on the activity patterns of the dusky grouper compared to the impact of scuba diving. A high heterogeneity existed in the response against most of the stressors, including the presence of scuba divers. Overall, the activity of dusky grouper was higher at night than at day, showing a positive relationship with wave height, water temperature, and current intensity and a negative one with the moon phase. Remarkably, our findings, based on novel biotelemetry tools, differed substantially from the common wisdom accepted for this species. In conclusion, there is no clear evidence of scuba divers influence on the general activity patterns of the dusky grouper. Beyond their relevance from an ecological perspective, these results provide useful insights for the sustainable management of coastal resources, suggesting that scuba diving, when properly carried out, can represent an important sector to foster for the blue growth of coastal communities.","[Pereniguez, J.

Tagged fish displayed three types of diel activity patterns in three different habitats: sand, rocky reefs and matte of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Individuals were more active during the day than at night. Overall, white sea bream displayed a remarkable behavioural plasticity in habitat use. Our results indicate that the observed behavioural plasticity in the marine protected area could be the result of multiple ecological and environmental drivers such as size, sex and increased intra-specific competition. Our findings support the view that habitat diversity helps support high densities of fishes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Between August 2010 and September 2012, we used acoustic telemetry to continuously monitor movements of 31 Lutjanus argentiventris (yellow snapper) and 25 Mycteroperca rosacea (leopard grouper) at Los Islotes, a small no-take reserve and reported spawning site for both species in the SW Gulf of California. Though the majority of fish from both species exhibited moderate levels of site fidelity to Los Islotes (snapper: present 49 +/- 30% of days since tagging, grouper: 64 +/- 30%), cluster analyses revealed multiple patterns of site fidelity within species. Approximately 30% of snapper exhibited decreases in site fidelity during the spawning season, and snapper did not spawn at the reserve during the study. Grouper spawning aggregations at Los Islotes were visually observed in 2011 and 2012, though the abundance of fish and the intensity of courtship behaviors were reduced in comparison with reported aggregations elsewhere in the Gulf. Three snapper and 2 grouper made repeated movements across pelagic waters between Los Islotes and Marisla Seamount, another documented aggregation site in the SW Gulf. The demonstrated variation in movements of these species over multiple temporal and spatial scales warrants consideration of movement patterns in assessments of reserve performance, as well as the combination of traditional fisheries regulations (e.g. size limits) with marine reserves throughout the Gulf.","[TinHan, Thomas; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA; [Erisman, Brad; Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weaver, Amy; Vazquez-Arce, Daniel] Sociedad Hist Nat Niparaja AC, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"TinHan, T (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA.",t.tinhan@gmail.com,"Erisman, Brad/P-1640-2019","Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio/0000-0002-8173-1432; TinHan, Thomas/0000-0002-5610-7718",Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture [DGOPA-05356-140710-3457],Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture,"We thank 3 anonymous reviewers for their help in improving the manuscript.

In studies of an organism's functional ecology, key behavioural traits such as foraging periodicity are assumed to be uniform across the species. In particular, the fundamental division between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns is usually assumed to be a fixed one, with organisms demonstrating physiological traits optimised for a particular diel rhythm. 2. In this study, we explore the activity rhythm of a tropical reef fish, the golden-lined rabbitfish, Siganus lineatus. We make use of acoustic telemetry (manual tracking), combined with underwater observations of feeding behaviour to investigate the diel foraging patterns of S. lineatus, at three sites around the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. 3. We found significant differences in the activity patterns of shoreline and reef-based populations of S. lineatus. Individuals inhabiting the boulder-shoreline site foraged during the day and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the two reef populations foraged only during nocturnal hours, remaining stationary at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish. 4. We suggest that S. lineatus is a diurnal nominal herbivore whose biological rhythm has developed the flexibility to be nocturnal. This development may simply represent the masking effects of predation, competition or ontogeny, or it may represent entrainment over an evolutionary time-scale necessary to enable the species to expand its range into the coral reef environment. 5. Either way, the results identify S. lineatus as a potential subject for research into the relative importance of the various biological forces driving divisions along the temporal niche axis and suggest that the species has the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at the ecological and evolutionary level.","[Fox, Rebecca J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Fox, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.fox@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011",,"Australian Research Council; Lizard Island Reef Research Foundation (LIDF); Australian Coral Reef Society; Vemco, a division of Amirix Pty Ltd","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Lizard Island Reef Research Foundation (LIDF); Australian Coral Reef Society; Vemco, a division of Amirix Pty Ltd","We thank A.

Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Currey, LM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Leanne.Currey@my.jcu.edu.au,"Currey-Randall, Leanne/AAS-8975-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Williams, Ashley/ABA-5921-2020; Williams, Ashley/G-2017-2014","Williams, Ashley/0000-0002-5530-0073; Currey-Randall, Leanne M/0000-0002-3772-1288; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Australian Research Council; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,"We thank the staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group for assisting with this project, particularly A.

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.","[Scott, Molly E.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Matley, Jordan K.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada",James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; University of Windsor,"Scott, ME (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",molly.scott@my.jcu.edu.au,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Pratchett, Morgan/A-9256-2010","Simpfendorfer, Colin/0000-0002-0295-2238; Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Matley, Jordan/0000-0003-4286-597X; Scott, Molly/0000-0002-5738-221X; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation,Fisheries Research and Development Corporation,"Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grant/Award Number: FRDCDCCEE",,74,13,13,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

The monitored fish was caught in the study site and surgically implanted with an ultrasonic transmitter. The fish displayed a regular diurnal rhythm during 25 days before leaving the area. Different patterns of spatial use were identified. The temporal succession of these patterns indicates that the minimum distance covered by the fish every day ranged between 20 and 200 m. Its home range was at least 5 ha. A decrease of the detection was observed before the departure of the fish. This decrease coincided with the beginning of the reproduction period in New Caledonia and supports the hypothesis of a fish departure for the reproductive event.

In this study, passive telemetry and fine-scale habitat data were integrated for the first time to investigate the relevance of community fishery reserves (CFRs) for managing reef fish resources. In Efate Island (Vanuatu), 38 thumbprint emperors Lethrinus harak (Lethrinidae) were tagged at 7 sites and tracked between April 2011 and February 2012 using an acoustic array of 16 receivers. The survey area extended over 11.3 km(2) of fringing reef in 3 coastal community tenures that included 3 small CFRs. Habitats were mapped using very high resolution satellite imagery and ground-truthing. Thirty fish were detected for up to 229 d (median = 153 d). Six geographical groups were identified among 21 resident fish. These groups showed strong fidelity to small sites (116 to 763 m) that were located in reserves and fished areas, across community tenures, and across 12 habitat types. Overall, 42 excursions were detected at several hundreds to thousands of meters from the fidelity sites along contiguous fringing reefs, across habitat types, and across boundaries of CFRs and community tenures. The estimated home range size of L. harak ranged from 116 to 3979 m (median: 763 m) and was highly varied within fish groups. We concluded that home range size and behavioral plasticity of L. harak limit the effectiveness of small individual CFRs for protecting this species. Networks of CFRs would be more effective but require management arrangements between neighbor communities.","[Leopold, Marc; Gabriault, H.; Andrefouet, S.; Dumas, P.] Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Leopold, Marc; Ham, J.; Raubani, J.; Dumas, P.] Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Chateau, O.; Gabriault, H.] Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea 98807, New Caledonia",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Léopold, M (corresponding author), Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.;Léopold, M (corresponding author), Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu.",marc.leopold@ird.fr,,"Dumas, Pascal/0000-0001-7369-8989",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),"This study was funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Pacific Fund, the Government of New Caledonia, and the Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department).

Traditionally, stock assessments measure reproductive potential as spawning stock biomass or egg production and do not include other aspects of reproductive behavior. Red drum make an excellent case study to assess these other aspects, as (1) they are highly fecund, pelagic spawners, like most exploited marine fishes; (2) their life cycle is delineated between nursery (estuarine) and adult (coastal and offshore) habitat; and (3) they are managed at these two spatial scales. This study was conducted from August 2012 to December 2013 and integrates data from multiple methods and spatial scales. Aerial surveys were used for large-scale monitoring of aggregations off two known estuarine nursery areas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, USA. Capture-based sampling in Tampa Bay coastal (n = 2581) and estuarine waters (n = 158) was used to assess reproductive state and to confirm coastal spawning. To assess spatial dynamics, we acoustically tagged two population components in the Tampa Bay system, subadults from the estuary (n = 20) and adults from the coastal spawning site (n = 60). Behavioral plasticity was seen in subadult recruitment to coastal habitat, with some subadults maturing and recruiting before or during the spawning season and others (14 of 20 acoustically tagged fish) recruiting at the end of the 2012 spawning season. Both adults and recruited subadults (n = 29) were consequently detected in the Charlotte Harbor array, 132 km to the south. Spawning-site fidelity to the Tampa Bay spawning site occurred at both the population and individual scales. Aggregations consistently occurred in Tampa Bay coastal waters during the spawning season, and approximately two-thirds of tagged adults returned in the 2013 spawning season. A similar proportion of subadults returned to the Tampa Bay spawning site, exhibiting natal homing. However, these first-time spawners arrived later than repeat spawners and were detected over shorter time periods. This study, and others like it, demonstrates how integrating data from individuals tracked over space and time with more traditional population-based sampling is changing our understanding of ecological processes that affect marine fish productivity and our ability to manage for sustainablity.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Burnsed, Sarah L.

A comprehensive array of acoustic receivers was deployed at two near-shore coastal sites in south-eastern Australia, to examine the movements, activity-space size and residency of a temperate rocky-reef, herbivorous species Girella elevata. Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure.

The Nassau Grouper Epinephelus striatus is a Caribbean coral reef fish that displays such spawning aggregations, which have been overfished to the point of threatening the species. Using acoustic telemetry, we examined the size at which Nassau Grouper migrate to spawning aggregations, the timing of migrations, and the distance of migration routes used by Nassau Grouper from within and outside of a large, no-take marine reserve in the central Bahamas. Fish (total n = 19) were tagged in 2004 (n = 6) and 2005 (n = 13) and were tracked for one to four spawning seasons. Fish that were 54 cm TL or greater made spawning migrations, with all but one migrating southward along the shelf edge of Exuma Sound for a distance of 70 km to over 200 km, usually during the December full moon. Fish typically made one migration annually, which lasted from 1 to 3 weeks, with fish remaining at spawning sites for only 1-2 d; however, when the full moon was early in the spawning season, several fish remained away from their home reefs through two lunar cycles or delayed their migrations by a month, and one fish made two migrations. Fish that were migrating for the first time had slower swimming speeds to spawning sites than did experienced fish, but swimming speeds were similar between the two groups during return migrations, suggesting that their migration behavior was learned. Our results demonstrate that spawning migration patterns for this species may be more variable in The Bahamas than at other Caribbean locations. The present findings also have important implications for the management of the species, including increasing the minimum size limit to 54 cm or larger and the use of both marine protected areas and seasonal closures to rebuild the spawning stock.","[Dahlgren, C.

In the Seychelles, FSAs of this species occur monthly between September and June around the full moon. To study the spawning aggregation dynamics of S. sutor, 39 reproductively active individuals were acoustically tagged and monitored at 3 known FSA sites (Pate Polite, Pate Desire and Pate Dividi) off the west coast of Praslin island (Seychelles) between October 2010 and April 2011. The presence and absence of tagged fish at the 3 sites were monitored using moored arrays of passive acoustic receivers, while the density of fish at the FSAs was quantified using underwater visual census (UVC). Most tagged fish (87.0%) detected in more than 1 spawning period showed fidelity to single spawning sites. Predominantly, tagged individuals arrived at FSA sites at dawn and departed at dusk. Spawning residency times at FSA sites ranged from 0.02 to 16.1 d. At Pate Polite, residency times were higher in the first half of the spawning season. Residency times were often several-fold shorter than aggregation duration which, when combined with patterns in arrival and departure times, indicates high turnover of fish within aggregations. The findings of this study provide information needed for emerging co-management schemes that aim to sustain this socio-economically important fishery.","[Bijoux, Jude P.; Dagorn, Laurent] IRD, UMR 212, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Berke, Gregory; Robinson, Jan] Seychelles Fishing Author, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Cowley, Paul D.] S African Inst Aquat Biodivers, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Soria, Marc] IRD, UMR 212, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Gaertner, Jean-Claude] IFREMER, UPF IRD ILM, UMR 241 EIO, Faaa, Tahiti, France; [Robinson, Jan] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer; James Cook University,"Bijoux, JP (corresponding author), IRD, UMR 212, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.",jude.bijoux@ird.fr,"Dagorn, Laurent/K-1002-2016; Cowley, Paul/M-4264-2017","Cowley, Paul/0000-0003-1246-4390",Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) [MASMA/OR/2008/06]; Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP) [SEY/SGP/OP4/Y3/RAF/2010/05]; Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) through the European Union (EU) of the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Protocols under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (IRD-DSF),Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA); Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP); Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) through the European Union (EU) of the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Protocols under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (IRD-DSF),This work was supported through grants from the Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program (Grant No. MASMA/OR/2008/06) of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) and from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP) to the Praslin Fishers Association (PFA) (Grant No. SEY/SGP/OP4/Y3/RAF/2010/05).

Relative to the total amount of available habitat, kelp bass showed a habitat selection preference for rock boulder, rock rubble and kelp habitat. These habitats offer high vertical relief, shade and large holes for shelter, and may attract and facilitate prey capture. Average home range size was 3 % of the area of the reserve. Only 1 of 12 tracked fish crossed the reserve boundary, but this accounted for less than 5 % of the fish's time. Natural habitat breaks along the reserve boundary may have further limited adult kelp bass movements.

Twelve adults were caught along the north-eastern coast of a small Mediterranean island, tagged with acoustic transmitters and released within or just outside the integral reserve. Fish detected, during both the seasons showed strong fidelity for the study area before and during the spawning season and their home range did not differ between seasons. Home ranges reached an asymptote between 12 and 174 days after release. Home range estimated by kernel utilization distributions ranged from 9,876 to 89,914 m(2), with core areas of 946 to 7,274 m(2). Temporal patterns frequently showed a dominant diel rhythm with most of detections occurring at daytime, independently of season. The variability in the movement patterns of D. vulgaris was lower between seasons (i.e., during and outside the spawning season) than at smaller temporal scale (i.e., between day and night) and was largely affected by inter-individual differences. Some conclusions arising from this and previous findings are useful to orient future studies on coastal fish movement and have direct implications for MPAs design.","[La Mesa, Gabriele; Consalvo, Ivan; Annunziatellis, Aldo; Canese, Simonepietro] Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res, I-00144 Rome, Italy",Italian Institute for Environmental Protection & Research (ISPRA),"La Mesa, G (corresponding author), Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res, Via V Brancati 60, I-00144 Rome, Italy.",gabriele.lamesa@isprambiente.it,"Canese, Simonepietro/AAA-5499-2019","Annunziatellis, Aldo/0000-0003-3461-2307; Canese, Simonepietro/0000-0001-6049-4506","Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea (MATTM), Accordo di Programma Triennale del MATTM/ICRAM [6/A/80]","Ministry of the Environment, Land and Sea (MATTM), Accordo di Programma Triennale del MATTM/ICRAM","The authors wish to thank Michela Angiolillo, Michela Giusti, Tommaso Petochi and Umberto Scacco for their assistance in field activities, and three anonymous reviewers whose criticisms improved the manuscript.

We acclimated four 1-year-old fish to shelters in cages before release and compared their movements with six nonacclimated fish. Since it was not possible to compare the behavioral pattern between the former and the latter fish due to the short periods the latter fish were available to be monitored, we also compared their movements with those of large nonacclimated fish that were less likely to be preyed upon. Sixty-seven percent of the nonacclimated fish showed atypical movements before the signals ceased to be detected, a pattern that suggested a predation event had occurred, whereas none of the acclimated and large nonacclimated fish showed the atypical movements. In addition, the probability of detection cessation was about 13 times lower in the acclimated than nonacclimated fish. The signal detection patterns suggest that the acclimated fish utilized night-time shelters from the first night after release, while the large nonacclimated fish started to utilize shelters several days after release. Therefore, it is likely that the shelter acclimation enhanced the shelter utilization by tuskfish, possibly decreasing post-release predation mortality.","[Kawabata, Yuuki; Arai, Nobuaki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Asami, Kimio; Kobayashi, Masato; Sato, Taku; Okuzawa, Koichi; Yamada, Hideaki; Yoseda, Kenzo] Fisheries Res Agcy, Ishigaki Trop Stn, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Okinawa 9070451, Japan; [Asami, Kimio; Yoseda, Kenzo] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Fisheries & Environm Inland Sea, Hiroshima 7390452, Japan; [Okuzawa, Koichi] Fisheries Res Agcy, Natl Res Inst Aquaculture, Minamiise, Mie 5160193, Japan",Kyoto University; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Kawabata, Y (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Inst E China Sea Res, Taira, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan.",yukikawabata0202@yahoo.co.jp,"Kawabata, Yuuki/H-4109-2019; Okuzawa, Koichi/J-2677-2012","Okuzawa, Koichi/0000-0002-0172-1008","Kyoto University, Information Education and Research Center; Fisheries Research Agency, Japan; [20-2242]","Kyoto University, Information Education and Research Center; Fisheries Research Agency, Japan;","We thank T.

This study tested the effect of release density on emigration, activity patterns, and space utilization by releasing juvenile mulloway (Sciaenidae: Argyrosomus japonicus) at low and high densities and monitoring movement intensively for 336h post release. Mulloway released at high densities had faster emigration and greater overall emigration rates than low density releases. Also, mulloway released at high densities used sub-optimal habitats at a greater frequency. Released fish dispersed into habitat patches at densities proportional to the quality of the habitat patch, consistent with density-dependent habitat selection. Targeting releases of small numbers of fish to the carrying capacity of individual patches of habitat will contribute to the success and economic viability of release programs in open systems. Releases of high densities of individuals or repeated releases at the same site may lead to increased emigration and losses from the stocked system. The capacity of a target habitat to support released fish can be rapidly assessed using pilot releases and intensive monitoring of acoustically tagged fish, prior to the implementation of large-scale release programs.","[Taylor, Matthew D.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.; Fairfax, Andrew V.; Suthers, Iain M.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Fairfax, Andrew V.; Suthers, Iain M.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; University of New South Wales Sydney; Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Taylor, MD (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",matt.taylor@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Suthers, Iain/C-4559-2008","Suthers, Iain/0000-0002-9340-7461",Recreational Fishing Trust [L40],Recreational Fishing Trust,"The authors would like to thank the following in their help in the field: T.

We predicted horn sharks would use an area restricted search (ARS) movement strategy to locate dense resource patches while minimizing energetic costs of travel and nighttime activity. As ectotherms, we predicted environmental temperature would play a significant role in driving movement and activity patterns. Methods Continuous active acoustic tracking methods and acceleration data loggers were used to quantify the diel fine-scale spatial movements and activity patterns of horn sharks. First passage time was used to identify the scale and locations of patches indicative of ARS. Activity was assessed using overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as a proxy for energy expenditure. Behavior within a patch was characterized into three activity patterns: resting, episodic burst activity, and moderate, consistent activity. Results After resting in daytime shelters, individuals travelled to multiple reefs throughout the night, traversing through depths of 2-112 m and temperatures of 10.0-23.8 degrees C. All sharks exhibited area restricted search patch use and arrived at their first patch approximately 3.4 +/- 2.2 h (mean +/- SD) after sunset. Sharks exhibited moderate, consistent activity in 54% of the patches used, episodic burst activity in 33%, and few (13%) were identified as resting at night. ODBA peaked while sharks were swimming through relatively deeper (similar to 30 m), colder channels when traversing from one patch to the next. There was no consistent pattern between ODBA and temperature. Conclusions We provide one of the largest fine-scale, high-resolution paired data sets for an elasmobranch movement ecology study. Horn sharks exhibited ARS movement patterns for various activity patterns. Individuals likely travel to reefs known to have profitable and predictable patches, potentially tolerating less suitable environmental temperatures. We demonstrate how gathering high-resolution information on the movement decisions of a community resident enhances knowledge of community structure and overall ecosystem function.","[Meese, Emily N.; Lowe, Christopher G.] CSULB Shark Lab, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Meese, Emily N.] Texas A&M Univ, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77551 USA",Texas A&M University System,"Meese, EN (corresponding author), CSULB Shark Lab, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.;Meese, EN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77551 USA.",emily.n.meese@gmail.com,,"Meese, Emily/0000-0003-4928-4297",USC Wrigley Graduate Fellowship; Donald R.

This study investigates area utilisation and activity patterns of 13 adult roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae) using telemetry and underwater observations. Acoustic transmitters implanted into C. laticeps in tanks had no apparent effects on growth and mobility. Natural behaviour of the treated fish in the field was verified by SCUBA divers. Manual boat- and diver-based tracking was carried out inside the Castle Rock MPA, False Bay, South Africa, over a 17-month period. A radio acoustic positioning system (VRAP, VEMCO Ltd) was used to record automatically fish positions over two 1-month periods during and after the spawning season of roman. Manually recorded fish positions and VRAP positions inside the triangle of buoys within the system were accurate within 10m; deviations increased with increased distance of the fish from the centre of the system and during unfavourable sea conditions. Analysis of movement data using a 95% fixed kernel algorithm suggests that roman occupy small home ranges of between 1 000m(2) and 3 000m(2), which shows that this species is well suited for protection in small MPAs. Interestingly, the home range size did not seem to be related to fish size or habitat quality. Swimming activity decreased at night. During periods of cold-water upwelling, fish retreated into caves. During the spawning season, females extended their home ranges, which result in a 'spill over' effect of adult fish into fishing areas.","Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa; Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Kerwath, SE (corresponding author), Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, Private Bag X2, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa.",skerwath@deat.gov.za,"Sauer, Warwick/GJI-2267-2022","Sauer, Warwick/0000-0002-9756-1757; Attwood, Colin/0000-0002-1045-3439; Kerwath, Sven/0000-0003-2751-5015",,,,,40,35,38,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1814-232X,1814-2338,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

Understanding long-term space use, including site fidelity and habitat usage, is necessary to implement effective and appropriate management actions for a species with extensive space and resource needs.ResultsIndividual L. analis were tracked over an average period of 316 days (range 125-509 days) and showed high site fidelity to relatively small home ranges (meanSD: 0.103 +/- 0.028 km(2), range 0.019-0.190 km(2)) and core use areas with low overlap among individuals. Most home ranges had a habitat composition dominated by seagrass and to a lesser degree, coral reef and/or pavement. Nighttime activity spaces were distinct from but contained within daytime areas. Conclusions: Mutton snapper showed strong site fidelity to home ranges in Brewers Bay. Two individuals that were absent from the array for more than a few hours were detected at separate arrays at spawning aggregation sites. This study expands upon knowledge of mutton snapper home range characteristics, highlights the importance of maintaining adjacent high-quality habitat types in any spatial management plan, and encourages the adoption of other types of management strategies, particularly for transient-aggregating species.","[Heidmann, Sarah L.; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Jossart, Jonathan] CSS, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Kimble, Melissa] Univ Maine, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA","University of the Virgin Islands; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

The 370,200 detections of 57 seabass in the study area revealed high residency in the period from late March-May to September-November, as well as high site fidelity (70.7%). Whereas the majority of seabass left the area in winter, 13 seabass stayed in the harbour experiencing temperatures as low as 2.8 & DEG;C. Two groups of seabass were identified having different core movement areas in the inner and outer harbours, although movement between the two areas was possible. The distinct differences in habitat use between these groups resulted in a significantly different level of exposure to fisheries under the same policy framework. By quantifying the level of protection of seabass, based on the spatiotemporal fisheries management in place, our study underlines the importance of taking into account movement behaviour when evaluating conservation measures.","[Goossens, Jolien; Moens, Tom] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Goossens, Jolien; Reubens, Jan] Flanders Marine Inst, Marine Observat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Villagra, Damian; Torreele, Els] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food, Anim Sci Unit, Marine Res Area, ILVO Marine Res, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [De Putter, Georges] Sights Nat, B-8490 Jabbeke, Belgium; [Verhelst, Pieterjan] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Aquat Management, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Flanders Marine Institute VLIZ; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Research Institute for Nature & Forest,"Goossens, J (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Goossens, J (corresponding author), Flanders Marine Inst, Marine Observat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Jolien.Goossens@UGent.be,"Moens, Tom/AAB-8701-2019; Reubens, Jan/MIN-6043-2025; Verhelst, Pieterjan/I-4864-2019","Verhelst, Pieterjan/0000-0002-2610-6941; Goossens, Jolien/0000-0002-0853-9153",,,,,62,3,3,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

To better understand spatial and temporal movement patterns and help determine the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve (Buck Island Reef National Monument, BIRNM), 55 queen triggerfish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked for 434.6 +/- 27.3 d (mean SE) within a large acoustic array in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Queen triggerfish displayed high site fidelity within the reserve during non-spawning months. Home range sizes, as measured by 95 % minimum convex polygons and kernel utilization distributions, averaged 2.44 t 0.30 and 3.34 +/- 0.17 km(2), respectively. High site fidelity was interrupted briefly during full moons from November to March (2015-2017), when 22 % of the tagged population (n = 12) undertook repeated migrations to a nesting area located approximately 12 km from BIRNM. During the same-season spawning periods, 5 other fish were exclusively detected at a receiver station within the reserve, indicating a possible local nesting area and resident (non-migratory) contingent of queen triggerfish. The high site fidelity of queen triggerfish during non-spawning months coupled with the discovery of a resident spawning population highlights the importance of BIRNM as a potential refuge from local fishing pressures. This study provides improved understanding of queen triggerfish movement ecology, an extremely valuable asset for the development of spatial management strategies throughout their range.","[Bryan, David R.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Bryan, David R.] Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Feeley, Michael W.] Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Inventory & Monitoring Ne, 18001 Old Cutler Rd Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Pollock, Clayton] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Natl Pk, 2100 Church St 100, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA",University of Miami; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; University of the Virgin Islands; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Bryan, DR (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Bryan, DR (corresponding author), Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",david.bryan@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007; Bryan, David/0000-0002-3846-1553",NPS [PMIS 141633]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (MARFIN) [NA13NMF4330167]; Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (National Science Foundation) [1355437]; Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1355437] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NPS; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (MARFIN)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (National Science Foundation); Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"National Park Service (NPS) staff Tessa Code and Jeff Gay were a tremendous help with in situ tagging operations and led the colossal task of downloading and maintaining the acoustic array.

Leopard coralgrouper Plectropomus leopardus is one of the main targeted fishery species in the Great Barrier Reef; however, there is no information on long-term movement patterns based on continuous and frequent data points. The objective of this study was to determine long-term space use of P. leopardus and identify any seasonal variation in movement trends. A total of 124 P. leopardus were implanted with V13P acoustic transmitters between 2010 and 2012 and passively tracked. Forty-five VR2W receivers were deployed at 2 reefs to track the movements of tagged individuals. The influence of time of day, season, tagging year, location, and water temperature on several movement measures was investigated. Of the 124 fish tagged, 74 individuals had sufficient detections to be included in analysis of horizontal movement, and 55 were used to analyse vertical movements. Results showed increased horizontal movements and higher activity in deeper water during the day in the austral summer. Movement patterns, both vertically and horizontally, appeared to be influenced by water temperature, but also corresponded with spawning season. Despite increased movements during summer, individuals typically remained in a small area similar to 0.5 km(2) throughout detection periods, indicating that long-range spawning-related movements are rare and that adequate resources are obtained within a small section of habitat year-round. This study provides long-term (similar to 3 yr) movement data for an economically significant reef fish and increases knowledge of spatial and temporal space use patterns.","[Matley, J.

Movements of an important recreational target species from the Mediterranean Sea, the parrotfish Sparisoma cretense. were determined in a marine protected area using passive acoustic telemetry, to evaluate site fidelity and homing, quantify home range and identify temporal patterns. Six adult parrotfish (20.8-29.8 cm total length) were caught along the north-eastern coast of Lampedusa (Italy) and surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Three fish were caught and released at the same site within the integral (i.e. no entry-no take) reserve, whereas the others were caught outside the reserve boundary and released at the mid reserve 0.5 km apart. Two of the three fish that were released away from the capture site demonstrated homing abilities. Four fish showed a strong site fidelity, whereas the others moved frequently in and out of the monitoring area. Home range sizes estimated over the period of monitoring (up to 207 days) varied from 70,387 to 256,398 m(2), with core areas of 16,688 to 84,946 m(2). Home range size did not differ significantly between day and night. Home ranges of all fish extended beyond the reserve boundaries, showing example of potential spillover into take zones. Temporal activity patterns of fish were diurnal with a dominant diel rhythm, likely due to a resting behaviour at night. Though not specifically designed to protect exploited fish, the marine reserve of Lampedusa seems adequate for the conservation and management of S. cretense. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We used acoustic telemetry to investigate movement patterns between bay nursery habitats and adult reef habitats by a common Caribbean fish (Lutjanus apodus). We hypothesized that juvenile fish residing in their nurseries increase their home range as they grow and eventually include coral reefs in their activity range before their permanent migration to this adult habitat. Tagged fish were detected by underwater receivers for a period up to 12 months and a clear diel pattern was visible with most detections occurring during nighttime. Bay-to-reef movements were undertaken by fish that were larger than fish that were only detected in the bay. Stable isotope values of fin tissue from fish that showed reef-ward movements were similar to those of fish remaining in the bay, indicating that these movements were likely exploratory behavior as opposed to repeated feeding excursions. Understanding cross-habitat ontogenetic movements is essential for identification of ecologically relevant spatial scales for management of coastal fish populations.","[Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Huijbers, Chantal M.; Nagelkerken, Ivan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Layman, Craig A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, David Clark Labs 127, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; North Carolina State University,"Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",ivan.nagelkerken@adelaide.edu.au,"Huijbers, Chantal/J-5176-2014; Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011","Huijbers, Chantal/0000-0001-5206-3415; Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI; U.S. National Science Foundation [0746164],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was financially supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VIDI Grant to IN, as well as U.S. National Science Foundation Grant OCE #0746164 to CAL.

Due to its large size and complex life history characteristics, it is vulnerable to overfishing and has undergone substantial population declines in parts of its range. Knowledge of the species' movement ecology is currently limited to only 2 previous studies, and very little is known about populations in the western Indian Ocean. The present study aimed to use passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the importance of a remote coral reef to a population of humphead wrasse in the Republic of Seychelles, and subsequently assess the efficacy of a proposed marine protected area at this location for protection of the species. Tagged fish (n = 20) exhibited persistent (> 500 d) site fidelity, with low dispersal distances (mean +/- SD: 6.44 +/- 4.0 km) and restricted core activity spaces (50% Brownian bridge kernel utilization density: 0.91 +/- 0.61 km(2)). Additionally, the study site was home to a group of large (total length 97.9 +/- 20.6 cm) and currently unexploited humphead wrasse that showed longterm predictable site fidelity and thus could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. The establishment of a proposed no-take marine protected area at the study site would encompass the core home range area of all tagged humphead wrasse and could effectively conserve this stronghold of Endangered fish to ensure the persistence of the species in Seychelles waters.","[Daly, Ryan; Peel, Lauren R.; Gordon, Luke; Lea, James S.

Many large MPAs are, however, impacted by illegal fishing activity conducted by unlicensed vessels. While enforcement of these reserves is often expensive, it would likely benefit from the integration of ecological data on the mobile animals they are designed to protect. Consequently, shark populations in some protected areas continue to decline, as they remain a prime target for illegal fishers. To understand shark movements and their vulnerability to illegal fishing, 3 years of acoustic tracking data, from 101 reef-associated sharks, were analysed as movement networks to explore the predictability of movement patterns and identify key movement corridors within the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) MPA. We examined how space use and connectivity overlap with spatially explicit risk of illegal fishing, through data obtained from the management consultancy enforcing the MPA. Using individual-based models, the movement networks of two sympatric shark species were efficiently predicted with distance-decay functions (>95% movements accurately predicted). Model outliers were used to highlight the locations with unexpectedly high movement rates where MPA enforcement patrols might most efficiently mitigate predator removal. Activity space estimates and network metrics illustrate that silvertip sharks were more dynamic, less resident and link larger components of the MPA than grey reef sharks. However, we show that this behaviour potentially enhances their exposure to illegal fishing activity. Synthesis and applications. Marine protected area (MPA) enforcement strategies are often limited by resources. The British Indian Ocean Territory MPA, one of the world's largest 'no take' MPAs, has a single patrol vessel to enforce 640,000 km(2)of open ocean, atoll and reef ecosystems. We argue that to optimize the patrol vessel search strategy and thus enhance their protective capacity, ecological data on the space use and movements of desirable species, such as large-bodied reef predators, must be incorporated into management plans. Here, we use electronic tracking data to evaluate how shark movement dynamics influence species mortality trajectories in exploited reef ecosystems. In doing so we discuss how network analyses of such data might be applied for protected area enforcement.","[Jacoby, David M.

Few studies have provided direct evidence of connectivity across seascapes, and the importance of benthic seascape structure on movement behavior is poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, we coupled hydro-acoustic technology to track fish with seafloor mapping and pattern analysis techniques from landscape ecology to quantify seascape structure. Bluestriped grunts Haemulon sciurus and schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus were tracked over 24 h periods using boat-based acoustic telemetry. Movement pathways, and day and night activity spaces were mapped using geographical information system (GIS) tools, and seafloor structure within activity spaces was mapped from high-resolution aerial photography and quantified using spatial pattern metrics. For both fish species, night activity spaces were significantly larger than day activity spaces. Fish exhibited a daytime preference for seascapes with aggregate coral reef and colonized bedrock, then shifted to night activity spaces with lower-complexity soft sediment including sand, seagrass, and scattered coral/rock. Movement path complexity was negatively correlated with seascape complexity. This demonstrates direct connectivity across multiple patch types and represents the first study to apply quantitative landscape ecology techniques to examine the movement ecology of marine fish. The spatially explicit approach facilitates understanding to the linkages between biological processes and the heterogeneity of the landscape. Such studies are essential for identifying ecologically relevant spatial scales, delineating essential fish habitat and designing marine protected areas.","[Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Biogeog Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Biogeog Branch, 1305 EW Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,,"Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",NOAA,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This research was supported by a NOAA cooperative agreement with the University of the Virgin Islands.

The spatial and temporal movements of 19 sea bream (Archosargus rhomboidalis), an ecologically important species in mangrove estuaries of the western Atlantic, were investigated in multiple bays on a Caribbean Island over two years using surgically implanted acoustic transmitters. Fish were almost continuously monitored (residency index 96-100%) by an array of hydrophones during the 11-13 month battery-life of their transmitters. Individual fish utilized small core areas (mean = 9.8 ha during daytime and 11.0 ha at night), displayed daily site fidelity (mean = 57% overlap in day night core area), showed no evidence of an ontogenetic increase in core habitat size, and many exhibited a change in the bays utilized during winter months which is coincident with suspected spawning. Fish captured from the same bay generally occupied the same spaces within the study area, and in similar proportions, compared to fish captured in adjacent bays. Fish from different bays did not mix and wander throughout the ecosystem even though it is all suitable habitat and is used by different groups of localized individuals. This similarity of occupancy patterns is limited to the spatial scale of bays and temporal scales of weeks or months. When considered at the resolution of individual receivers and hourly time steps, most fish are not in close proximity to one another for the vast majority of the time. Although some pairs of fish had as many as 84% of their hourly detections on the same receivers in the month after tagging, they gradually spent less time near each other, even though their overall pattern of movements was consistent at the scale of whole bays. This highlights the importance of examining movements of fish on multiple spatial scales and time-intervals to understand their interactions.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Monaco, Mark E.; Winship, Arliss J.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, MSE,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss J.] CSS Inc, 10301 Democracy LaneSuite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ruffo, Ashley] ERT Inc, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 3013 Estate Golden Rock, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA; [Holloway, Nathaniel Hanna] Natl Pk Serv, 2100 Church St 100, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

However, information on the movement behavior of individual fish, over fine temporal and spatial scales, continues to be limited. While conducting a larger project in the northern Florida Keys in 2002, we surgically-tagged a small number of Scarus coeruleus Bloch 1786 and S. taeniopterus Desmarest in Bory de Saint-Vincent 1831 with acoustic transmitters inside the Conch Reef Research Only Area (a no-take marine reserve). Our objective was to characterize the movement of both species across Conch Reef, and to quantify any fish fidelity to the site where they were caught and released. All fish were captured, surgically-tagged, and released in situ during a saturation mission to the Aquarius Undersea Laboratory. Movement of tagged fishes was recorded in 5 receiving zones formed by the overlapping ranges of 3 acoustic receivers deployed on the seafloor. Results show limited movement of both species occurred across Conch Reef. Recorded site fidelity was higher among tagged S. taeniopterus than among S. coeruleus and varied considerably among individuals. While the number of fish departures from the receiving zones was varied, the majority of departures for each species were less than 30 min in duration for both species, suggesting that when departures occurred, the fish did not travel far. Future efforts will significantly expand the number of receivers at Conch Reef such that both movement and site fidelity can be quantified with increased temporal and spatial resolution.","Stellwagen Bank Natl Marine Sanctuary, Scituate, MA 02066 USA; Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ N Carolina, Natl Undersea Res Ctr, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Boston University; University of North Carolina,"Lindholm, J (corresponding author), Pfleger Inst Environm Res, 901-B Pier View Way, Oceanside, CA 92054 USA.",james@pier.org,,,,,,,15,14,17,0,18,UNIV PUERTO RICO,MAYAGUEZ,"COLLEGE ARTS SCIENCES, MAYAGUEZ, PR 00680 USA",0008-6452,,,CARIBB J SCI,Caribb.

In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators, but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated. We used results of acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analyses to investigate the diel and seasonal movements of Galapagos sharks Carcharhinus galapagensis and giant trevally Caranx ignobilis captured from a mesophotic reef (depth: 50 to 70 m) at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. All predators associated with mesophotic reefs performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements, diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) and others performing reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the summer spawning periods. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to their variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra- specific competition. Mesophotic reefs may provide some prey to upper level predators but also serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients, particularly from shallow to mesophotic reefs.","[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Meyer, Carl G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA NOS Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Wallsgrove, Natalie J.; Popp, Brian N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of St Andrews; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Papastamatiou, YP (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",ypapastamatiou@gmail.com,,"Popp, Brian/0000-0001-7021-5478; Kosaki, Randall/0000-0003-1363-5702; Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",University of Florida Animal Care Protocol [201105813]; National Geographic Committee for Research Exploration [8951-11]; National Science Foundation [OCE-1041329]; Scottish Funding Council [HR09011]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1040810] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,University of Florida Animal Care Protocol; National Geographic Committee for Research Exploration(National Geographic Society); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Scottish Funding Council; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank the crew of the NOAA research vessel 'Hi'ialakai' for supporting all field work in the NWHI.

Among MPAs, a large percentage has been created with the implicit goal of protecting shark populations, including 17 shark sanctuaries which fully protect sharks throughout their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas represents a long-term MPA for sharks, following the banning of commercial longlining in 1993 and subsequent designation as a shark sanctuary in 2011. Little is known, however, about the longterm behavior and space use of sharks within this protected area, particularly among reef-associated sharks for which the sanctuary presumably offers the most benefit. We used acoustic telemetry to advance our understanding of the ecology of such sharks, namely Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), over two discrete islands (New Providence and Great Exuma) varying in human activity level, over 2 years. We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space.

Eleven mature female Deacon Rockfish were tagged and monitored during an 11-month period, at a nearshore rocky reef off Seal Rock, Oregon, USA, an area of recurring seasonal hypoxia (defined as dissolved oxygen concentration [DO] < 2 mg l(-1)). Two tags were detected leaving the study area by day 35, indicating predation or emigration. Three tags became inactive within the array, indicating tag loss or fish death. Six resident fish inhabited the array for 246-326 days. Resident fish exhibited high site fidelity, small home ranges (mean 95% KDE = 4907 m(2)), and consistent activity patterns for the duration of the summertime high-resolution array (5 months), except during seasonal hypoxia. Resident fish were strongly diurnal in summer, with high levels of daytime activity above the bottom in relatively rugose habitat, followed by nighttime rest periods in deeper, less rugose habitat. During summertime hypoxia, resident fish exhibited less daytime activity during daytime hours with no rest periods at night, inhabited shallower water depths, and moved well away from their core activity areas on long, erratic forays. During the winter, diel patterns were less evident with higher activity levels at night (than in the summer) and lower activity levels in the day (than in the summer). We propose that some Deacon Rockfish continuously inhabit nearshore reefs throughout the year, but that daily/seasonal movement patterns, seasonally occurring hypoxia, and prey preferences for planktonic organisms influence relocation.","[Rasmuson, Leif K.; Blume, Mathew T.

Coral reefs are no exception. However, there is a paucity of information relating to the performance of acoustic receivers on coral reefs. Our results suggest that the detection performance of acoustic receivers may be significantly impacted by the unique nature of the reef environment. This study assessed the performance of passive acoustic receivers on a typical inner-shelf fringing reef, Orpheus Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The detection range and diel performance variability of acoustic receivers was assessed using two parallel lines of 5 VR2W receivers spanning 125 m, deployed on the reef base and reef crest. Two 9-mm acoustic transmitters were moored at opposite ends of each receiver line. The working detection range for receivers was found to be approximately 90 m for the transmitter moored on the reef base and just 60 m for the transmitter moored on the reef crest. However, the detection range on the reef crest increased to 90 m when just the reef crest receivers were considered, highlighting importance of optimal receiver deployment. No diel patterns in receiver performance or detection capacities were detected, suggesting that no corrections are required when interpreting nocturnal versus diurnal activity patterns. We suggest that studies aiming for complete coverage of a site within a reef environment will require receivers in close (< 100 m) proximity, and that the placement depth of receivers must be a major consideration, with shallow receivers exhibiting a greater detection range than those on the reef slope. Our results highlight the challenges imposed by coral reefs for acoustic telemetry and the importance of receiver placement for studies conducted within these habitats.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Fox, R.

However, little is known about juvenile stingray movement patterns and habitat use in coral reefs. This study used active acoustic telemetry to determine fine-scale diel movement patterns and habitat use of juvenile cowtail stingrays (Pastinachus ater) in a coral reef flat environment. Seven cowtail stingrays (4 males and 3 females) were manually tracked between April and December 2016. Each individual was tracked over 2 days, generating a total of 14 active tracks ranging from 4.91 to 9 h. Specimens moved at an average speed of 2.44 m min(-1) +/- 0.87 SE, with minimum distances travelled ranging from 546 to 1446 m. Tracking data showed that juvenile cowtail stingrays move in response to tidal cycles, moving faster and in straighter pathways during incoming and outgoing tides. Juvenile cowtail stingrays also showed a strong affinity to sand flat areas and mangrove edge areas. These areas provide food resources and potential refuges for juvenile rays to avoid predators. Coral reef flats were identified as secondary refuge for juveniles during the lowest tides. Future research is necessary to fully unveil the major drivers of juvenile cowtail stingray seasonal and ontogenetic movement patterns and habitat use within coral reef flat environments. This information is important to establish a full understanding of juvenile cowtail stingray ecology, but could also improve management and conservation policies.","[Martins, A. P. B.; Bierwagen, S.

Accurate site descriptions associated with these aggregations are essential for the conservation of R. typus, an Endangered species. Although aggregations have become valuable hubs for research, most site descriptions rely heavily on sightings data. In the present study, visual census, passive acoustic monitoring, and long range satellite telemetry were combined to track the movements of R. typus from Shib Habil, a reef-associated aggregation site in the Red Sea. An array of 63 receiver stations was used to record the presence of 84 acoustically tagged sharks (35 females, 37 males, 12 undetermined) from April 2010 to May 2016. Over the same period, identification photos were taken for 76 of these tagged individuals and 38 were fitted with satellite transmitters. In total of 37,461 acoustic detections, 210 visual encounters, and 33 satellite tracks were analyzed to describe the sharks' movement ecology. The results demonstrate that the aggregation is seasonal, mostly concentrated on the exposed side of Shib Habil, and seems to attract sharks of both sexes in roughly equal numbers. The combined methodologies also tracked 15 interannual homing-migrations, demonstrating that many sharks leave the area before returning in later years. When compared to acoustic studies from other aggregations, these results demonstrate that R. typus exhibits diverse, site-specific ecologies across its range. Sightings-independent data from acoustic telemetry and other sources are an effective means of validating more common visual surveys.","[Cochran, Jesse E.

In spring and summer, daily depth distribution followed a pattern in which the fish inhabited greater depths on the 26-50% and 51-75% waxing moon. Fish daily movement distances were five times greater during spring and summer than in winter, but no repeatable patterns were noted in relation to lunar periodicity.

We tagged 39 sharks (mostly adult females) of which 31 were detected regularly throughout the study. Sharks displayed strong inter-annual residency with greater attendance at monitored sites during summer than winter months. More individuals were detected during the day than at night. Mean depths of tagged sharks increased from 35 m in winter to 60 m in spring following an increase in water temperature at 60 m, with maximum mean depths attained when water temperatures at 60 m stabilised around 29 degrees C. Sharks descended to greater depths and used a wider range of depths around the time of the full moon. There were also crepuscular cycles in mean depth, with sharks moving into shallower waters at dawn and dusk each day. We suggest that daily, lunar and seasonal cycles in vertical movement and residency are strategies for optimising both energetic budgets and foraging behaviour. Cyclical patterns of movement in response to environmental variables might affect the susceptibility of reef sharks to fishing, a consideration that should be taken into account in the implementation of conservation strategies.","[Vianna, Gabriel M.

The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) in the study area was 0.92 +/- 0.13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. Acoustic tracking also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area. However, the diel detection periodicity (24 h) was only evident for certain periods of the tracking time, as revealed by a continuous wavelet transform. The habitat selection index of tagged S. schlegelii suggested that S. schlegelii preferred natural reefs, mixed sand/artificial reef bottoms and mixed bottoms of boulder, cobble, gravel and artificial reefs. The preference of this species for the artificial reefs that were recently deployed in the study area suggests that artificial seascapes may be effective management tools to attract individuals. The vertical movement of tagged S. schlegelii was mostly characterized by bottom dwelling behavior, and there was high individual variability in the vertical migration pattern. Our results have important implications for S. schlegelii catchability, the implementation of marine protected areas, and the identification of key species habitats, and our study provides novel information for future studies on the sustainability of this important marine resource in eastern China.","[Zhang, Yingqiu; Xu, Qiang; Liu, Hui; Xu, Qinzeng; Yang, Hongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yingqiu; Liu, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Alos, Josep] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB)","Xu, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",xuqiangcas@126.com; hshyang@qdio.ac.cn,"Liu, Huibiao/H-3208-2011","Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539","Ministry of Sciences and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2011BAD13B02]; State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China [201205023, 201305043]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11020404]; Marie Curie Post-Doc grant (FP7-PEOPLE-IEF) [327160]","Ministry of Sciences and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Marie Curie Post-Doc grant (FP7-PEOPLE-IEF)(European Union (EU))","HY was supported through the National Key Technology Research and Development Program (grant no. 2011BAD13B02) provided by Ministry of Sciences and Technology of the People's Republic of China (URL: http://www.most.gov.cn/eng/), the Non-Profit Marine Sector (grant no. 201205023, 201305043) provided by State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China (URL: http://www.soa.gov.cn/english/) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

This is particularly relevant for defining what factors are driving the presence, location, and movements of individuals. The long-term movement and space use patterns of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, were examined on a whole of reef scale in the southern Great Barrier Reef to define whether movement and activity space varied through time. Twenty-nine C. amblyrhynchos were tracked for over 2 years to define movement patterns. All individuals showed high residency within the study site, but also had high roaming indices. This indicated that individuals remained in the region and used all of the monitored habitat (i.e., the entire reef perimeter). Use of space was consistent through time with high reuse of areas most of the year. Therefore, individuals maintained discrete home ranges, but undertook broader movements around the reef at times. Mature males showed greatest variation in movement with larger activity spaces and movement into new regions during the mating season (August-September). Depth use patterns also differed, suggesting behaviour or resource requirements varied between sexes. Examination of the long-term, reef-scale movements of C. amblyrhynchos has revealed that reproductive activity may play a key role in space use and activity patterns. It was unclear whether mating behaviour or an increased need for food to sustain reproductive activity and development played a greater role in these patterns. Reef shark movement patterns are becoming more clearly defined, but research is still required to fully understand the biological drivers for the observed patterns.","[Heupel, M.

Despite a wide Indo-Pacific distribution, little is known about the spatial ecology of silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), compromising the ability to effectively manage their populations. We examined the residency and movements of silvertip sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 VR2W acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Twenty-seven individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored from 70 to 731 d. Residency index to the study site ranged from 0.05 to 0.97, with a mean residency (+/- SD) of 0.57 +/- 0.26, but most individuals were detected at or near their tagging reef. Clear seasonal patterns were apparent, with fewer individuals detected between September and February. A large proportion of the tagged population (> 71 %) moved regularly between reefs. Silvertip sharks were detected less during daytime and exhibited a strong diel pattern in depth use, which may be a strategy for optimizing energetic budgets and foraging opportunities. This study provides the first detailed examination of the spatial ecology and behavior of silvertip sharks on coral reefs. Silvertip sharks remained resident at coral reef habitats over long periods, but our results also suggest this species may have more complex movement patterns and use larger areas of the GBR than common reef shark species. Our findings highlight the need to further understand the movement ecology of silvertip sharks at different spatial and temporal scales, which is critical for developing effective management approaches.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

Temporal partitioning of resources can reduce intra-specific competition, but this has seldom been examined in predators in marine ecosystems. Here, we used 8 years of acoustic telemetry data from 27 receivers deployed in a large coastal embayment to examine the temporal residency of 51 Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), during their breeding season. We found that the residency lengths of male and female Port Jackson sharks on breeding reefs differed throughout the breeding season, with males showing longer residency at the start of the season and females showing longer residency at the end of the season. Port Jackson sharks also showed a 24-h or diel periodicity in their detection patterns. Although the majority of individuals were nocturnal, a small proportion of sharks was detected more frequently during the day, possibly to reduce competition for resources. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the sex ratio nor the size of diurnal and nocturnal individuals.

However, many knowledge gaps about their biology and ecology hinder conservation efforts. Here we used a combination of acoustic telemetry and acceleration datalogger technology to gain fundamental insights into the fine-scale behaviour, habitat use, size of activity spaces, and residency of adult female bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae) in the Ningaloo region of northwestern Australia. Acoustic tracking data over one year demonstrated that female bottlenose wedgefish continuously resided in a relatively small area of a productive coral reef lagoon. Acceleration data revealed that bottlenose wedgefish were nocturnal, with time of day having a greater influence on activity than tidal patterns. Bottlenose wedgefish also increased activity with seasonally increasing temperatures. We identified several discrete behavioural signatures in the acceleration data, inferred to correspond to chafing, settling/burying behaviour, foraging behaviour, and escape behaviour, based on their kinematics. Further observations are required to confirm these behaviours with certainty. Additionally, according to datalogger and acoustic data, tagged bottlenose wedgefish rarely inhabited areas greater than 2 m deep. Together, these first insights into behaviour and habitat use of adult female bottlenose wedgefish highlight the importance of nearshore habitats for this species and indicate that they may be highly resident to specific areas. Our findings provide important insight into the conservation of bottlenose wedgefish in northwestern Australia, including potential effectiveness of protected areas and interactions with specific anthropogenic threats such as shoreline development and recreational beach fishing.","[Lear, Karissa O.; Morgan, David L.; Gleiss, Adrian C.; Bateman, Rebecca L.] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Estrabeau, Carlos; Bateman, Rebecca L.] Fin Focus Res, Exmouth, WA, Australia; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Newport Aquarium, Newport, KY 41071 USA; [Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Environm & Conservat Sci, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Bignell, Colby] Environm Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Bignell, Colby] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Pillans, Richard D.] Environm Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia",Murdoch University; Murdoch University; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lear, KO (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",k.lear@murdoch.edu.au,"Pillans, Richard/F-2458-2012; Morgan, David/H-9794-2019; Gleiss, Adrian/E-5960-2011","Bignell, Colby James/0000-0003-4732-8655; Bateman, Rebecca/0000-0003-3282-1973; Morgan, David/0000-0003-1948-1484; Gleiss, Adrian/0000-0002-9960-2858; Lear, Karissa/0000-0002-2648-8564",CAUL; Murdoch University; Oceania Chondrichthyan Society; Minderoo Exmouth Field Laboratory; Artemis Films; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; Integrated Marine Observing System,CAUL; Murdoch University; Oceania Chondrichthyan Society; Minderoo Exmouth Field Laboratory; Artemis Films; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Integrated Marine Observing System,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea, first documented in the Caribbean in 2002, has rapidly expanded its range, displacing native seagrasses, and overgrowing bare sand. The southern stingray (Hypanus americanus) uses shallow seagrass and sand habitats for foraging. This paper examined the impacts of the invasive seagrass, H. stipulacea, on southern stingray behavior, foraging and movement patterns using acoustic telemetry and visual observations. From 2015 to 2018, 15 southern stingrays (14 juveniles of unknown sex and 1 female) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored within an acoustic array in Brewers and Perseverance Bays, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. The residence time, rates of movement and activity spaces for 50% and 95% utilization distributions (UD) were calculated for day and night periods. Tagged southern stingrays were detected within the array on average for 260 d (range 11-801 d) and residency for all individuals averaged 53% over the monitoring period (1079 d). Mean rates of movement per individual ranged from 40 to 150 m h(-1), was lowest during the nighttime and were significantly higher during crepuscular periods. Activity spaces during day and night periods were nearly identical and averaged 0.05 km(2) and 0.25 km(2) for 50% and 95% UD, respectively. Distances between day and night 50% UD activity spaces was 148 m (range 8-409 m) and mean percent overlap was 38%. In addition to acoustic monitoring, benthic cover of available habitats and visual surveys of stingray behavior and habitat preferences were conducted along fixed transects. Monotypic stands of the invasive H. stipulacea seagrass represented 42% of benthic cover, followed by bare sand (27%), mixed patches of native and invasive seagrasses (23%) and the native Syringodium filiforme (7%). A habitat selection index (HSI) comparing the percent cover of available habitats and habitats occupied by stingrays found a strong preference for the native seagrass S. filiforme (HSI = 2.30) and bare sand (HSI = 1.79) compared to H. stipulacea (HSI = 0.70). Visual surveys also revealed that 50% of foraging stingrays were in S. filiforme, while 28% and 17% were foraging in H. stipulacea and bare sand, respectively. Our results are an important baseline for examining how further expansion of H. stipulacea may affect southern stingray movement patterns and foraging preferences.","[Legernes, Michele] Bellona Environm Fdn, Radhusgata 28, N-0513 Oslo, Norway; [Legernes, Michele] Marea, Ormsundveien 16, N-0198 Oslo, Norway; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers, US Virgin Isl, MD 00803 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Ctr Coastal Studies, Shark Ecol Program, 5 Holway Ave, Provincetown, MA 02657 USA",University of the Virgin Islands,"Nemeth, RS (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers, US Virgin Isl, MD 00803 USA.",ricknemeth.usvi@gmail.com,,"Legare, Bryan/0000-0001-6791-0293",Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) (NSF) [1355437],Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) (NSF),"Funding provided by Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) Grant (NSF #1355437) .

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to infer movement patterns of seven adult C. latus within Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a no-take marine protected area (MPA) northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, a preliminary exploration of detections recorded outside of BIRNM was used to gain knowledge of the potential for larger scale movements. Ascertaining long-term movement patterns, including residency, mobility, and identifying core activity spaces can play a considerable role in how MPAs, like BIRNM, are adapted to meet the needs of mobile species.ResultsHigh residency index values were observed for individual C. latus within the BIRNM array (meanSE: 0.913 +/- 0.04, range 0.75-1.0) across the 17 months monitored. Most fish were also detected on receivers located outside BIRNM. An observed to expected detection ratio revealed that despite high residency, only 9.6% of expected transmissions were detected based on the average tag transmission rate. Network analysis revealed high individual connectivity with many of the receivers inside BIRNM and a large number of core use receivers (mean: 10.7, range 6-14) within individual networks.ConclusionsMost C. latus were present in BIRNM at least twice per day, but were overall detected below the expected rates, demonstrating mobility, large core activity spaces and wide use of the acoustic array inside BIRNM and greater St. Croix shelf. How residency is inferred from acoustic telemetry detections, and interpreted for species with variable mobility, has important considerations for spatial management planning and telemetry analyses. For MPA development to meet the spatial requirements of species with mixed resident-mobile spatial ecology, detailed long-term movement data are required. Assessing residency in MPAs using acoustic telemetry should be formalized and carefully interpreted based on specific species, environmental conditions, and array configuration.","[Novak, Ashleigh J.; Becker, Sarah L.; Finn, John T.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI 00820 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Novak, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",novakjashleigh@gmail.com,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011","National Park Service, Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14]; University of Massachusetts Amherst","National Park Service, Puerto Rico Sea Grant; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Funding for this research was provided by the National Park Service, Puerto Rico Sea Grant (Project Number: R-101-2-14), and University of Massachusetts Amherst.",,46,21,24,0,5,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2050-3385,,ANIM BIOTELEM,Anim.

An example is cleaning symbiosis, which has been observed in terrestrial and marine environments. The most recognized form of marine cleaning symbiosis is that of cleaner fishes and their clients. Cleaner species set up cleaning stations on the reef, and other species seek out their services. However, it is not well understood how the presence of cleaning stations influence movements of large highly mobile species. We examined the role of cleaning stations as a driver of movement and habitat use in a mobile client species. Here, we used a combination of passive acoustic telemetry and in-water surveys to investigate cleaning station attendance by the reef manta ray Mobula alfredi. We employed a novel approach in the form of a fine-scale acoustic receiver array set up around a known cleaning area and tagged 42 rays. Within the array, we mapped structural features, surveyed the distribution of cleaner wrasse, and observed the habitat use of the rays. We found manta ray space use was significantly associated with blue-streak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus distribution and hard coral substrate. Cleaning interactions dominated their habitat use at this site, taking precedence over other life history traits such as feeding and courtship. This study has demonstrated that cleaning symbiosis is a driver for highly mobile, and otherwise pelagic, species to visit inshore reef environments. We suggest that targeted and long-term use of specific cleaning stations reflects manta rays having a long-term memory and cognitive map of some shallow reef environments where quality cleaning is provided. We hypothesize that animals prefer cleaning sites in proximity to productive foraging regions.","[Armstrong, Asia O.; Armstrong, Amelia J.; Bennett, Michael B.; Dudgeon, Christine L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.; Everett, Jason D.] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, Ctr Applicat Nat Resource Math CARM, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.; Everett, Jason D.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Queensland Biosci Precinct QBP, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Townsend, Kathy A.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Hervey Bay, Qld, Australia; [Everett, Jason D.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hays, Graeme C.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Pederson, Hugh] Innovasea, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of the Sunshine Coast; University of New South Wales Sydney; Deakin University,"Armstrong, AO (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",asia.armstrong@uqconnect.edu.au,"Pederson, Hugh/HTO-8689-2023; Richardson, Anthony/B-3649-2010; Dudgeon, Christine/A-1633-2017; Everett, Jason/C-4557-2008; Townsend, Kathy/K-9486-2016","Pederson, Hugh/0000-0002-0899-2978; Everett, Jason/0000-0002-6681-8054; Townsend, Kathy/0000-0002-2581-2158; Armstrong, Amelia/0000-0001-8103-4314; Armstrong, Asia/0000-0002-9307-0598",Australian Research Council [LP150100669]; University of Queensland Research Scholarships; ARC Discovery Grant [DP190102293]; Australian Research Council [LP150100669] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); University of Queensland Research Scholarships; ARC Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: LP150100669; University of Queensland Research Scholarships; ARC Discovery Grant, Grant/Award Number: DP190102293",,86,13,14,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.
