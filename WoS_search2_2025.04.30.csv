In this study, we selected 3 species, Sparisoma viride (Scaridae), Acanthurus chirurgus (Acanthuridae), and Lutjanus apodus (Lutjanidae), to quantify their home ranges, evaluate their site fidelity, and identify movement patterns in Martinique (14 degrees 36' N, 61 degrees 32' W). Two complementary tagging methods (external Floy tags and acoustic telemetry) were utilised to monitor movement patterns on different spatial scales from November 2009 to November 2011. We tagged 673 A. chirurgus, 131 L. apodus, and 217 S. viride with Floy tags and 30 A. chirurgus, 47 L. apodus, and 37 S. viride with acoustic tags. The results revealed that several individuals maintained a small preferential site for several months to over a year. Other individuals were able to move long distances (< 9 km) outside the MPA over a short period (< 3 d) and never returned to the MPA. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tagging methods and long-term observations to improve the monitoring of fish movement relative to MPA design and effectiveness. Despite the fragmented habitat in the studied MPA, the results highlight that small MPAs (9.56 km(2)) could protect the 3 studied species. This study also demonstrated that natural barriers (large areas of silt and sand) were crossed by some individuals. Our findings provide relevant information on these species that should be utilised to better inform MPA design and decision-making processes, management, and overall MPA effectiveness.","[Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Rousseau, Yann] CNRS Guyane, USR3456, Cayenne 97300, French Guiana; [Legrand, Helene] DEAL, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU),"Garcia, J (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol Hidrol, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",jessicagarcia.mpa@gmail.com,"Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009",,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,"Financial support for this study was provided by Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.

We performed an acoustic tagging study implemented within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Australia, to assess the movement patterns, home range and diel activity of snapper (Chrysophrys auratus; Sparidae); a species of significant recreational and commercial fishing importance in Australia. The study focused on C. auratus movements around Cabbage Tree Island, which is predominantly a no-take sanctuary zone (no fishing), with an array of acoustic stations deployed around the island and adjacent reefs and islands. Thirty C. auratus were tagged with internal acoustic tags in November 2010 with their movements recorded until September 2014. Both adult and juvenile C. auratus were observed to display strong site fidelity to Cabbage Tree Island with a mean 12-month residency index of 0.83 (range = 0 low to 1 high). Only three fish were detected on acoustic receivers away from Cabbage Tree Island, with one fish moving a considerable distance of similar to 290 kms over a short time frame (46 days). The longest period of residency recorded at the island was for three fish occurring regularly at the site for a period of 1249 days. Chrysophrys auratus displayed strong diurnal behaviour and detection frequency was significantly higher during the day than at night; however, there was no significant difference in detection frequency between different hours. This study demonstrates that even small-scale protected areas can benefit C. auratus during multiple life-history stages as it maintains a small home range and displays strong site fidelity over a period of 3 years.","[Harasti, David; Gallen, Christopher] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia; [Lee, Kate A.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Hughes, Julian M.; Stewart, John] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Macquarie University; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Harasti, D (corresponding author), NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia.",david.harasti@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Stewart, John/N-7330-2016; Harasti, David/I-1266-2019; Hughes, Julian/D-2695-2017","Hughes, Julian/0000-0002-0884-8386",NSW Recreational Fishing Trust [DPI60],NSW Recreational Fishing Trust,"This study was supported by NSW Recreational Fishing Trust (Project DPI60) (to JS).

However, most evidence of such movement has been inferred from density and size structure differences among these habitats in tropical waters. The aim of the present Study was to directly evaluate multiple habitat use by an ecologically and economically important reef fish, the gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, in subtropical waters. An integrated set of activities was conducted, including tagging and tracking of individuals and underwater video photography to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of movements among neighboring mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitats in the northern Florida Keys, USA. Results of ultrasonic acoustic and mini-archival tagging indicated that L. griseus exhibits: (1) a distinct diel migration pattern, whereby shallow seagrass beds; are frequented nocturnally and mangroves and other habitats with complex structure are occupied diurnally, and (2) bay-to-ocean movement, occurring during the known spawning season of L. griseus in this region. Video photography confirmed diel movement among seagrass and mangrove habitats. Results of this subtropical study corroborate direct and indirect evidence obtained in tropical waters of multiple inshore habitat use by L. griseus, as well as its seasonal movement into or towards offshore reefs. For resource managers charged with designing and implementing management plans for subtropical coastal habitats and fisheries, our findings provide direct support for the strategy of conserving both inshore seagrass and mangrove habitats as well as offshore coral reefs.","[Luo, Jiangang; Serafy, Joseph E.; Sponaugle, Su; Teare, Paul B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Serafy, Joseph E.] NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kieckbusch, David] Milian Swain & Associates Inc, W Palm Beach, FL 33411 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Luo, JG (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",jluo@rsmas.miami.edu,,,,,,,44,110,124,0,63,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

These transmitters, which are often smaller than conventional types, have primarily been used in freshwater, yet limited information is available on their efficacy in estuarine or marine environments. This study quantified detection ranges (DR) of 180-kHz tags and potential environmental factors influencing detection probability in three different habitats within a large embayment in Costa Rica. Mangrove (DR at 50% detection efficiency; DR50 = 121.0 m +/- 8.1 s.e.) and transitional estuarine (DR50 = 145.6 m +/- 12.2) habitats had relatively high detection ranges, albeit smaller than similar studies in freshwater, highlighting the effectiveness of using this frequency in tropical marine environments. By contrast, performance within rocky reef habitat was poor (DR50 consistently <0 m), which may have been caused by the heterogeneous bottom structure or close proximity detection interference (CPDI) due to ambient noise. This study provides novel information on the performance of high-frequency acoustic tags in a tropical marine environment serving as an important case study as investigations of the spatial ecology of small fishes in both marine and freshwater become more common.","[Matley, J.

Our data revealed a home reef area (residency rate of 44.9%) with an increased activity revealed by movements at dawn and dusk toward and between two adjacent reef passages, probably for foraging. The fish was absent from its resident reef between October and December 2010 and 2012, corresponding to the time known for spawning aggregations of this species in New Caledonia. A skipped spawning seems to have occurred in 2011. We hope these data will be complemented in the future by locating the spawning site or sites and thus provide adequate conservation measures. The Coral Sea links two World Heritage Sites, the Australian Great Barrier Reefs and the New Caledonian coral reefs.

To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5 +/- 0.5 km(2) compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km(2). Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending similar to 80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km(2) array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements. This study indicates that despite exhibiting stable and small home ranges over periods of one to two years, more than half the population of spangled emperor move at scales greater than average sanctuary size within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park.","[Pillans, Richard D.; Babcock, Russel C.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Downie, Ryan; Patterson, Toby A.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Bearham, Douglas; Thomson, Damian P.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Perth, WA, Australia; [Boomer, Andrew] SIMS, IMOS Anim Tagging & Monitoring, Mosman, NSW, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Pillans, RD (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Richard.Pillans@csiro.au,"Bearham, Doug/G-8689-2011; Pillans, Richard/F-2458-2012; Thomson, Damian/C-3047-2014; Patterson, Toby/B-3836-2011; Babcock, Russell C/A-3794-2012","Pillans, Richard/0000-0001-6234-8764; Thomson, Damian/0000-0001-5485-1562; Babcock, Russell C/0000-0002-7756-1290; Patterson, Toby/0000-0002-7150-9205; Bearham, Douglas/0000-0002-2977-2843",Ocean Flagship of CSIRO; Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI); CSIRO; Australian Animal Tracking and Monitoring System (AATAMS); facility of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS),Ocean Flagship of CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Australian Animal Tracking and Monitoring System (AATAMS); facility of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS),"This study was funded by the Wealth from Ocean Flagship of CSIRO and the Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI).

Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (similar to 14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of similar to 250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.","[Barnett, Adam] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Abrantes, Katya G.; Seymour, Jamie; Fitzpatrick, Richard] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Barnett, Adam; Fitzpatrick, Richard] Reef Channel, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Tasmania; James Cook University,"Barnett, A (corresponding author), Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",adam.barnett@utas.edu.au,"Barnett, Anthony/A-8205-2019; Seymour, Jamie/C-9748-2013","Seymour, Jamie/0000-0002-4805-3289; Barnett, Adam/0000-0001-7430-8428","Digital Dimensions, Australia; Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia; Digital Dimensions","Digital Dimensions, Australia; Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia; Digital Dimensions","Funding was supplied by Digital Dimensions, Australia, through the production of the Discovery Channel Shark Week special 'Mysteries of the Shark Coast' and by the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia.

The monitored fish was caught in the study site and surgically implanted with an ultrasonic transmitter. The fish displayed a regular diurnal rhythm during 25 days before leaving the area. Different patterns of spatial use were identified. The temporal succession of these patterns indicates that the minimum distance covered by the fish every day ranged between 20 and 200 m. Its home range was at least 5 ha. A decrease of the detection was observed before the departure of the fish. This decrease coincided with the beginning of the reproduction period in New Caledonia and supports the hypothesis of a fish departure for the reproductive event. Despite the survey of only one specimen, the home range and movement calculated using acoustic telemetry are different in scale than the reported scuba-based visual estimations.

Groupers are especially susceptible to overexploitation, because they aggregate to reproduce at specific locations and times. An understanding of the spatial dynamics of these fishes is critical for fisheries management and conservation. However, movements and migration dynamics of endangered reef fishes are poorly known. We show, using acoustic telemetry, that Nassau groupers Epinephelus striatus exhibit highly synchronised migration to spawning sites, despite their otherwise solitary habits. Reproductive adults leave their individual territories in shallow waters near the winter full moons, and migrate to the same spawning site up to 4 times yr(-1). At the spawning site, a remarkable population-wide depth change occurs within an hour as individuals dive to a maximum depth of 255 m. Our results greatly expand the previously known migration frequency and depth range of this species, and reveal an unexpected yet predictable complexity of adult fish migration between habitats. Effective conservation of this threatened species requires that deeper reefs and the timing of migration events be incorporated into fisheries management plans.","Univ Calif, Sea Grant Extens Program, Moss Landing Marine Labs, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; Scripps Inst Oceanog, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Conservat, La Jolla, CA 90293 USA; CSIC, Ctr Estudis Avancats Blanes, Blanes, Spain; Univ Barcelona, Dept Ecol, Fac Biol, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain",Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centre d'Estudis Avancats de Blanes (CEAB); University of Barcelona,"Starr, RM (corresponding author), Univ Calif, Sea Grant Extens Program, Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",starr@mlml.calstate.edu,"Ballesteros, Enric/K-6497-2012",,,,,,43,96,117,0,35,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In addition, these techniques rarely allow direct continuous behavioural assessments or the recording of environmental interactions, especially for highly mobile species. Here, we trial a novel method of assessing small-scale movement patterns of marine vertebrates using an unmanned aerial vehicle that could complement longer-term tracking approaches. This approach is unlikely to have behavioural impacts and provides high accuracy and high frequency location data (10 Hz), while subsequently allowing quantitative trajectory analysis. Unmanned aerial vehicle tracking is also relatively low cost compared to single-use acoustic and GPS tags. We tracked 14 sharks for up to 10 min in a shallow lagoon of Heron Island, Australia. Trajectory analysis revealed that Epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) displayed sinusoidal movement patterns, while Blacktip Reef Sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) had more linear trajectories that were similar to those of a Lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Individual shark trajectory patterns and movement speeds were highly variable. Results indicate that Epaulette sharks may be more mobile during diurnal low tides than previously thought. The approach presented here allows the movements and behaviours of marine vertebrates to be analysed at resolutions not previously possible without complex and expensive acoustic arrays. This method would be useful to assess the habitat use and behaviours of sharks and rays in shallow water environments, where they are most likely to interact with humans.","[Raoult, Vincent] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, 11 Chittaway Rd, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia; [Raoult, Vincent; Tosetto, Louise; Williamson, Jane E.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2109, Australia; [Tosetto, Louise; Williamson, Jane E.] Macquarie Univ, MQMarine, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Williamson, Jane E.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",University of Newcastle; Macquarie University; Macquarie University; Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Raoult, V (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, 11 Chittaway Rd, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia.;Raoult, V (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2109, Australia.",Vincent.raoult@newcastle.edu.au; louise.tosetto@hdr.mq.edu.au; jane.williamson@mq.edu.au,"Williamson, Jane/G-9871-2011; Raoult, Vincent/H-6038-2019","Raoult, Vincent/0000-0001-9459-111X; Tosetto, Louise/0000-0002-8102-579X; Williamson, Jane/0000-0003-3627-4508",Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; University of Newcastle,Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; University of Newcastle,Many thanks to the staff at Heron Island Research Station for their assistance during numerous research trips.

Despite the important top-down pressure this species likely exerts on fish communities within its foraging territories, the specifics of spatial ecology remain relatively unknown. This study tracked 17 great barracuda throughout Buck Island Reef National Monument, a marine-protected area located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (17.786944 degrees N, - 64.620556 degrees W) from July 2014 to May 2016. Broad- and fine-scale acoustic telemetry was used to examine individual variability and study population patterns in residency, site fidelity, territoriality, and complexity of spatial use within home ranges. Network analysis of broad-scale data revealed spatial and temporal differentiation among the population in location of core use areas and showed that these areas contained multiple unique receiver groups or communities, a product of spatial or temporal variation within core activity spaces. Results from the fine-scale positioning system reinforced spatial and temporal partitioning in core use areas between individuals, indicating territorial behaviors, and showed evidence for both resident and transient movements. Preliminary fine-scale analysis also suggested diel variation in location of activity spaces. Although ubiquitous throughout all shallow water habitats, detection patterns for the study population appear to be influenced by high residency, territoriality, spatial partitioning, and diel variation. Understanding the complexities of individual space use is fundamental to ecologically founded and effective area-based spatial management frameworks at community scales.","[Becker, Sarah L.; Finn, John T.; Novak, Ashleigh J.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI USA; [Lundgren, Ian] NOAA Fisheries, Off Habitat Conservat, Habitat Protect Div, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Becker, SL; Jordaan, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",sarah.becker3@gmail.com; ajordaan@eco.umass.edu,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Becker, Sarah/0000-0001-5840-6079; Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011",University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Park Service; Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14],University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Park Service; Puerto Rico Sea Grant,"This research was funded by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, National Park Service, and Puerto Rico Sea Grant (Project Number R-101-2-14).",,63,13,18,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

However, few studies have focused on the fine-scale movements related to reproduction, a key feature in a population's perpetuation. Knowledge of movements modulated by reproduction is particularly important since migrations towards spawning grounds may increase the vulnerability to threats if these occur outside protected areas. Further, reproductive behavioural polymorphism is widely understudied but may affect reproductive success. In this work, we used acoustic telemetry to study a harvested fish, Diplodus sargus, within a small no-take zone in Portugal. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to focus on both the environmental and spatial features affecting D. sargus reproduction and the first to explore intraspecific variability of spawning movements. We report, during the spawning period, short-term (<1 d) and synchronised wider movements towards the open sea and deeper areas-'extraordinary movements'-involving 34% of the individuals. These extraordinary movements were associated with environmental factors known to trigger reproduction in this species (low but increasing photoperiod and temperature, waxing and full moon phases). Our results suggest that different behavioural groups (residents, commuters and low site-attached fish) exhibiting differences in spatial use may aggregate and spawn simultaneously, which may contribute to the maintenance of behavioural polymorphisms and the species' evolutionary adaptability. These findings have implications for the conservation of D. sargus and are relevant to other species that also conduct such critical migrations. Our results should enable adaptive management of fisheries targeting this species.","[Pedaccini, Marie; Sousa, Ines; Bentes, Luis; DeBenito-Abello, Carmela; Goncalves, Jorge M.

To improve this situation for reef fishes, we introduced a novel response variable method that treats signal detections as proportions (i.e., percent transmissions detected or detection rates) and compared this against prior approaches to examine the influence of array and transmitter performance, signal distance and environmental factors on detection rates. We applied this method to tagged snappers and groupers in the Florida reef ecosystem and controlled range-tests on static targets in Bayboro Harbor, Florida, to provide methodological guidance for the planning and evaluation of passive array studies for coral reef fishes. Results: Logistic regression analysis indicated detection rates were primarily a non-linear function of tag distance from receiver. A 'model-weighted' function was developed to incorporate the non-linear relationship between detection rate and distance to provide robust positioning estimates and allow for easy extension to tags with different ping rates. Conclusions: Optimal acoustic array design requires balancing the interplay between receiver spacing, detection rates, and positioning error. Spacing receivers at twice the distance of the modeled 50% detection rate may be appropriate when quantification of overall space use is a priority, and would provide a minimum of 75% detection rate. However, for research where missing detections within the array is unacceptable or time-at-arrival based fine-scale positioning is needed, tighter receiver spacing may be required to maintain signal detection probability near 100%.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.; Smith, Steven G.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Franklin, Erik/ABC-1088-2020; Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007; Franklin, Erik/0000-0002-8660-3085",National Park Service [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grant [NA17RJ1226]; American Society for Engineering Education's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Glenda Kelley; Scott Donahue; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; United States Geological Survey; Stock Island Oceanside Marina,National Park Service; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); American Society for Engineering Education's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Glenda Kelley; Scott Donahue; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Stock Island Oceanside Marina,"The authors thank Dry Tortugas National Park; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary; the captains of Andy Griffiths Charters of Key West, Florida; D.B.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness.","[Pittman, Simon J.; Monaco, Mark E.; Kendall, Matthew S.; Poti, Matthew; Clark, Randall D.; Wedding, Lisa M.; Caldow, Chris] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.; Legare, Bryan; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Islands, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Plymouth, Ctr Marine & Coastal Policy Res, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Texas Parks & Wildlife, Dickinson Marine Lab, Dickinson, TX USA; [Wedding, Lisa M.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Woods Inst Environm, Monterey, CA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands; University of Plymouth; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Stanford University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Wedding, Lisa/GRY-3972-2022","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [0814417]; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-31-1-06]; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy [NA09NMF4270068]; NOAA [NA08NOS4260348]; USGS State Partnership Program [07ERAG0078]; EPSCoR; Office Of The Director [0814417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USGS State Partnership Program; EPSCoR; Office Of The Director(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"SJP, MEM, AMF and LMW were supported by U.S. National Park Service, NOAA Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA) and NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program.

However, most studies have focused on the diurnal component of these aspects; nocturnal patterns are less known. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing diel movement patterns in ecologically and commercially important nocturnal coral reef fishes. We evaluate 122-days of acoustic telemetry data from 4 nocturnal species in 2 coral reef fish families (Haemulidae and Lutjanidae) on the Great Barrier Reef. For all species, we found a clear division between daytime resting areas on the reef and a move towards off-reef areas at night. This was highlighted in the low number of detections at night and the high average transitions between receivers at twilight. Over our study period, average nocturnal space use area (minimum convex polygon) of Plectorhincus gibbosus was 328,089 m2, Plectorhincus lineatus 28,828 m2, and Lutjanus carponotatus 20,369 m2. However, results from a Principal Component Analysis revealed that space use, and movement, varied substantially within species; for 3 of the 4 species the main axis of variation correlated with individual-level behaviour. These large differences in individual space use patterns highlight the need for caution when using species averages when considering ecosystem functions. Overall, our preliminary observations provide a glimpse into the large spatial extent, potential habitat connectivity, and intra and interspecific variation in activity patterns among large nocturnal Indo-Pacific reef fishes. This highlights their potential importance in maintaining ecosystem links between coral reefs and adjacent habitats.","[Collins, William P.; Bellwood, David R.; Morais, Renato A.; Siqueira, Alexandre C.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Morais, Renato A.] Univ Paris Sci & Lettres, CRIOBE, UAR3278, Perpignan, France; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Data Technol Hub, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TropWATER, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Siqueira, Alexandre C.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Sch Sci, Perth, WA, Australia",James Cook University; Universite PSL; James Cook University; James Cook University; Edith Cowan University,"Collins, WP (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",william.collins@my.jcu.edu.au,"Siqueira, Alexandre/AAJ-5987-2020; Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011; Araujo, Renato/AAA-7903-2021","Siqueira, Alexandre C./0000-0001-7970-4024; Waltham, Nathan/0000-0003-0058-773X; Collins, William/0000-0001-8390-6526","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council [CE140100020, FL190100062]; Australian Research Council (DRB); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council (DRB)(Australian Research Council); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","We thank Joanna A.

Bluespine unicornfish were site-attached to home ranges situated within the reserve boundaries and their movements were aligned with topographic features. Two different diel movement patterns ('commuting' and 'foraying') were observed. Commuters made crepuscular migrations of several hundred meters between daytime foraging areas and nighttime refuge holes. Foraying fish did not partake in crepuscular migrations and utilized refuge holes both day and night. Two bluespine unicornfish were also nocturnally active. There was little direct evidence of dispersal from the reserve but differences in bluespine unicornfish abundance and size among reef habitat zones were consistent with ontogenetic habitat shifts. The influence of habitat topography on bluespine unicornfish movements suggests that gross habitat characteristics could be used to predict reef fish movements. This could provide a simple method for setting marine reserve boundaries at sites for which empirical fish movement data are unavailable.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021",,,,,,37,100,114,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Scientists and managers have sought to understand the effects of artificial reefs on reef fish ecology by focusing on fish residency and movement at artificial reefs with less attention paid to broader spatial and temporal patterns in reef fish movements among a seascape of artificial reefs and other natural habitats. We used novel large-scale (> 15 km(2)) geopositioning acoustic telemetry arrays to track the 3-dimensional movements of tagged red snapper (n = 59) and gray triggerfish (n = 15) among multiple nGOM artificial reefs up to 333 days. Tagged fish moved frequently among artificial reefs and had shorter residence times at the release reef (43 days for red snapper and 3 days for gray triggerfish) than reported in previous studies. Both species displayed high individual variability in movement dynamics, as well as seasonally variable diel patterns of habitat use, height above bottom, and distance to reefs, which may have been driven by dynamic influences of predation risk, physiological constraints, or foraging over time and space. The wider seascape view revealed in this study demonstrates the importance of including multiple artificial reefs over long timescales to capture individual, spatial, and temporal variability in reef fish movement.","[Bohaboy, Erin C.; Patterson, William F.

This study used acoustic telemetry to investigate movements of reef fish relative to the boundary of the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM) in Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands. Although created to enhance ecosystem protection, VICRNM boundaries were established purely on the basis of adjacency to public versus privately owned lands. Transmitters were implanted into a diversity of reef fish species representative of the local community whose movements were logged for one year on an array of acoustic-receivers that were positioned within, outside, and along the MPA boundary. Results indicate that the boundary has coincidentally aligned with a deep sandy area that does not cross through continuous reef or mangrove habitat. This acted as a natural barrier to movements of species such as Lutjanus griseus, Epinephelus guttatus, Cephalopholus cruentatus, Holocentrus rufus, and Sparisoma aurofrenatum. Other species were more mobile and were routinely detected outside VICRNM, especially at night, such as L. synagris, Haemulon plumierii, and H. sciurus. In addition to fish movements in relation to the VICRNM boundary, network analysis revealed several hotspots of concentrated fish activity including a reef promontory and bay mouths. Investment in enforcement of existing regulations to protect fish is warranted to realize the full potential of this MPA. Using these types of data, management actions in this and other MPAs can be focused on those species and locations that would experience the greatest benefit.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, CCMA,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] CSS Dynamac Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Monaco, Mark E.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

The site fidelity and behavior of 15 sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and 10 gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus) were determined before, during, and after pile driving. No obvious signs of mortality or injury to tagged fish were evident from the data. There was a significant decline in the residency index for mangrove snapper at the construction wharf after pile driving compared with the baseline, although this may be influenced by natural movements of this species in the study area rather than a direct response to pile driving.","[Iafrate, Joseph D.; Watwood, Stephanie L.; Crocker, Steven E.] Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Environm Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA; [Reyier, Eric A.] InoMed Hlth Applicat Inc, Kennedy Space Ctr Ecol Program, Environm Serv, Cape Canaveral, FL 32899 USA; [Gilchrest, Matthew] Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Environm Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA; [Gilchrest, Matthew] McLaughlin Res Corp, Middletown, RI 02840 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; US Navy Naval Sea Systems Command; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Kennedy Space Center; United States Department of Defense; United States Navy; US Navy Naval Sea Systems Command,"Iafrate, JD (corresponding author), Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr, Environm Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA.",joseph.iafrate@navy.mil; stephanie.watwood@navy.mil; eric.a.reyier@nasa.gov; matthew.gilchrest.ctr@navy.mil; steven.crocker@navy.mil,"Watwood, Stephanie/AAE-7191-2019","Watwood, Stephanie Lynn/0009-0006-4884-7034; Crocker, Steven/0000-0003-2698-0193; Iafrate, Joseph/0009-0000-8945-2086",USFF Command [N46]; Canaveral Port Authority; NUWC In-House Lab Independent Research Program,USFF Command; Canaveral Port Authority; NUWC In-House Lab Independent Research Program,"We thank the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Ecological Program; LCDR James Westermeyer and the Naval Ordnance Test Unit; Doug Scheidt and Jane Provancha from InoMedic Health Applications (IHA) at the KSC, FL; and Don George and Angy Chambers at the Air Force 45th Space Wing Natural Assets Office for key logistical support.

Seasonal migrations of Mutton Snapper Lutjanus analis between protected nearshore areas and spawning grounds on Riley's Hump in Dry Tortugas, Florida, were assessed from 2008 to 2012 by acoustic telemetry. Individual fish showed synchronized reproductive migrations (up to 5 trips fish(-1) yr(-1)) from resident habitats to spawning grounds swimming at an estimated 63 +/- 18 cm s(-1) (mean +/- SD) over minimum linear distances up to 35.2 km. Migrations occurred from April to August, corresponding with the lunar cycle and an increase in water temperature from 25 to 30 degrees C. Fish arrived on spawning grounds on the full moon and stayed for 7 +/- 2 d (mean +/- SD). Observations of multiple spawning events made one to five days after the full moon in the late afternoon confirm these movements as spawning migrations. Functional migration areas (109.59 +/- 61.01 km(2) ; mean +/- SD), which included estimates of staging/courtship/spawning area (4.51 +/- 1.84 km(2) [mean +/- SD]) and home site area (2.50 +/- 1.31 km(2) [mean +/- SD]), were combined to estimate the minimum catchment area of the population studied (291.3 km(2)). Although this study focuses on movements and habitat use of a single fish species in the Tortugas, the results are relevant to the design of marine reserve networks intended to protect and manage fishes that undergo transient spawning migrations in other locations as well.","[Feeley, Michael W.; Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro; Barbera, Paul; Hunt, John] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA; [Switzer, Ted] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Burton, Michael] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Feeley, Michael W.] Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Network, 18001 Old Cutler Rd,Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA",Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Feeley, MW (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA.;Feeley, MW (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Network, 18001 Old Cutler Rd,Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA.",michael_feeley@nps.gov; danielle.morley@myfwc.com; alejandro.acosta@myfwc.com; paul.barbera@myfwc.com; john.hunt@myfwc.com; ted.switzer@myfwc.com; michael.burton@noaa.gov,"Burton, Michael/ABE-4500-2020","Morley, Danielle/0000-0001-7286-0606","USGS State Partnership Program [007-0083-023, 08ERAG0007]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program [MOA-2001-683, 004/7477 (1007-2009), (006)/7910, MOA-2010-026/8081]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (NOS) [MOA-2010-026/8081]; Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida [DFO 0809-03]; National Park Service [DRTO-2008-SCI-0003, DRTO-2010-SCI-0006]; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary [FKNMS-2008-015, FKNMS-2013-040]",USGS State Partnership Program; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (NOS); Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida; National Park Service; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary,"This research was supported by the USGS State Partnership Program (Project Number: 007-0083-023 and Grant # 08ERAG0007), NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (MOA-2001-683 Amendment No. 004/7477 (1007-2009), (Amendment No.006)/7910; NOS Agreement No. MOA-2010-026/8081), and Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant (DFO 0809-03) through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida and conducted under scientific research permits issued by the National Park Service (DRTO-2008-SCI-0003, DRTO-2010-SCI-0006) and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS-2008-015, FKNMS-2013-040).

We used visual surveys and acoustic telemetry to investigate density and movement of 2 Brazilian endemic and highly targeted reef fish species inside and outside a coral reef NTZ, and subsequently inferred the effectiveness of the NTZ for protecting these species. To do so, visual surveys were performed on protected and unprotected reefs between 2016 and 2017. Moreover, 20 gray parrotfish Sparisoma axillare and 9 Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored from December 2016 to October 2017. For both species, fish densities were significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost. The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs, predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were small (0.10 to 0.45 km(2)), and both species presented spatially segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88% for S. axillare and 95% for L. alexandrei. The results showed that small NTZs that are important to part of the life cycle of a target species are an effective measure to conserve reef fish populations, and also highlight the importance of fisheries management outside NTZs.","[Lippi, Daniel Lino; Bertoldi Gaspar, Ana Lidia; Maida, Mauro; Ferreira, Beatrice Padovani] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Coxey, Mariana Sofia] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rooker, Jay R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Rooker, Jay R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Rezende, Sergio Magalhaes] Natl Ctr Res & Conservat Marine Biodivers Northea, BR-55578000 Tamandare, Brazil; [Dance, Michael A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Instituto Superior Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Lippi, DL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil.",daniel_lippi@hotmail.com,"Ferreira, Beatrice/A-5786-2013; Rooker, Jay/M-3197-2013","Gaspar, Ana Lidia Bertoldi/0000-0002-8030-9758; Lippi, Daniel/0000-0003-0272-9420; Rooker, Jay/0000-0002-5934-7688","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuc [441632/2016-5]; Petrobras S.A.-Programa Petrobras Ambiental; CNPQ [140950/2016-8, 151219/2021-4, PVE 155131/2016-8, 309216/2018-4]; GEFMAR/DIBIO/ICMBio; [PVE 401594/2014-9]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuc(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Petrobras S.A.-Programa Petrobras Ambiental(Petrobras); CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); GEFMAR/DIBIO/ICMBio;","This work was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuco (441632/2016-5), and the visiting scholar program (PVE 401594/2014-9).

Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Currey, LM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Leanne.Currey@my.jcu.edu.au,"Currey-Randall, Leanne/AAS-8975-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Williams, Ashley/ABA-5921-2020; Williams, Ashley/G-2017-2014","Williams, Ashley/0000-0002-5530-0073; Currey-Randall, Leanne M/0000-0002-3772-1288; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Australian Research Council; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,"We thank the staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group for assisting with this project, particularly A.

Here, we report on the horizontal movements and residency of juvenile reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) at a recently discovered nursery site in the Wayag lagoon, Raja Ampat, Indonesia. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we provide further corroborative evidence that the lagoon serves as an important M. alfredi nursery. A total of 34 juvenile rays were photo-identified from 47 sightings in the sheltered nursery between 2013-2021. Five (14.7%) of these individuals were resighted for at least 486 days (~1.3 years), including two juveniles resighted after 641 and 649 days (~1.7 years), still using the nursery. Visually estimated (n=34) disc widths (DW) of juveniles using the nursery site ranged from 150-240 cm (mean +/- SD: 199 +/- 19), and the DW of two juveniles measured using drones were 218 and 219 cm. Five juveniles were tracked using GPS-enabled satellite transmitters for 12-69 days (mean +/- SD: 37 +/- 22) in 2015 and 2017, and nine juveniles were tracked using passive acoustic transmitters for 69-439 days (mean +/- SD: 182 +/- 109) from May 2019-September 2021. Satellite-tracked individuals exhibited restricted movements within Wayag lagoon. The minimum core activity space (50% Utilisation Distribution-UD) estimated for these five individuals ranged from 1.1-181.8 km(2) and the extent of activity space (95% UD) between 5.3-1,195.4 km(2) in area. All acoustically tagged individuals displayed high residency within the nursery area, with no acoustic detections recorded outside the lagoon in the broader Raja Ampat region. These juveniles were detected by receivers in the lagoon throughout the 24 h diel cycle, with more detections recorded at night and different patterns of spatial use of the lagoon between day and night. The observed long-term residency of juvenile M. alfredi provides further compelling evidence that the Wayag lagoon is an important nursery area for this globally vulnerable species. These important findings have been used to underpin the formulation of management strategies to specifically protect the Wayag lagoon, which will be instrumental for the survival and recovery of M. alfredi populations in Raja Ampat region.","[Setyawan, Edy; Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Erdmann, Mark V.] Univ Auckland, Conservat Int Aotearoa, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mambrasar, Ronald; Hasan, Abdi W.] Birds Head Seascape Program, Konservasi Indonesia, Sorong, Indonesia; [Sianipar, Abraham B.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Stevenson, Ben C.] Univ Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland, New Zealand; [Jaine, Fabrice R.

In this study, passive telemetry and fine-scale habitat data were integrated for the first time to investigate the relevance of community fishery reserves (CFRs) for managing reef fish resources. In Efate Island (Vanuatu), 38 thumbprint emperors Lethrinus harak (Lethrinidae) were tagged at 7 sites and tracked between April 2011 and February 2012 using an acoustic array of 16 receivers. The survey area extended over 11.3 km(2) of fringing reef in 3 coastal community tenures that included 3 small CFRs. Habitats were mapped using very high resolution satellite imagery and ground-truthing. Thirty fish were detected for up to 229 d (median = 153 d). Six geographical groups were identified among 21 resident fish. These groups showed strong fidelity to small sites (116 to 763 m) that were located in reserves and fished areas, across community tenures, and across 12 habitat types. Overall, 42 excursions were detected at several hundreds to thousands of meters from the fidelity sites along contiguous fringing reefs, across habitat types, and across boundaries of CFRs and community tenures. The estimated home range size of L. harak ranged from 116 to 3979 m (median: 763 m) and was highly varied within fish groups. We concluded that home range size and behavioral plasticity of L. harak limit the effectiveness of small individual CFRs for protecting this species. Networks of CFRs would be more effective but require management arrangements between neighbor communities.","[Leopold, Marc; Gabriault, H.; Andrefouet, S.; Dumas, P.] Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Leopold, Marc; Ham, J.; Raubani, J.; Dumas, P.] Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Chateau, O.; Gabriault, H.] Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea 98807, New Caledonia",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Léopold, M (corresponding author), Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.;Léopold, M (corresponding author), Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu.",marc.leopold@ird.fr,,"Dumas, Pascal/0000-0001-7369-8989",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),"This study was funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Pacific Fund, the Government of New Caledonia, and the Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department).

We analysed similar to 2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Friess, Claudia; Bickford, Joel W.; Addis, Dustin T.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Griffin, Lucas P.; Morley, Danielle; Casselberry, Grace A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, South Florida Reg Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Marathon, FL USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA USA; [Hammerschlag, Neil; Rider, Mitchell J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Smukall, Matthew J.; van Zinnicq Bergmann, Maurits P.

Behavioral impacts of sound generated from these activities on fish typically have a greater area of influence than physical injury, and may therefore adversely affect a greater portion of the local population. This study used acoustic telemetry to assess the movement, residency, and survival of 15 sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and 10 grey snapper (Lutjanus griseus) in Port Canaveral, Florida, USA, in response to 35 days of pile driving at a wharf complex. No obvious signs of mortality or injury to tagged fish were evident from the data. Received sound pressure levels from pile strikes on the interior of the wharf, where reef fish primarily occur, were on average 152 -157 dB re 1 mu Pa (peak). No significant decrease in sheepshead daytime residency was observed during pile driving within the central portion of the wharf and area of highest sound exposure, and no major indicators of displacement from the exposure wharf with the onset of pile driving were observed. There was evidence of potential displacement from the exposure wharf that coincided with the start of pile driving observed for 2 out of 4 grey snapper, along with a decrease in daytime residency for a subset of this species with high site fidelity prior to the event. Results indicate that snapper may be more likely to depart an area of pile driving disturbance more readily than sheepshead, but were less at risk for behavioral impact given the lower site fidelity of this species.","[Iafrate, Joseph D.; Watwood, Stephanie L.; Dossot, Georges A.; Crocker, Steven E.] Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA; [Reyier, Eric A.; Scheidt, Douglas M.] Kennedy Space Ctr Ecol Program, Kennedy Space Ctr, FL USA; [Reyier, Eric A.; Scheidt, Douglas M.] Integrated Miss Support Serv, Kennedy Space Ctr, FL USA",National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Kennedy Space Center; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); Kennedy Space Center,"Iafrate, JD (corresponding author), Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr Div, Newport, RI 02841 USA.",joseph.iafrate@navy.mil,"Watwood, Stephanie/AAE-7191-2019","Iafrate, Joseph/0009-0000-8945-2086; Crocker, Steven/0000-0003-2698-0193; Watwood, Stephanie Lynn/0009-0006-4884-7034","United States Fleet Forces Command [N46, N4657911PO005NR]",United States Fleet Forces Command,"Funding was provided by United States Fleet Forces Command N46, Funding Document N4657911PO005NR.

The yellowmouth barracuda Sphyraena viridensis and the almaco jack Seriola rivoliana are the 2 most abundant bentho-pelagic reef predators in the Azores archipelago (central North Atlantic). They aggregate at shallow offshore seamounts, and largely share diet preferences, but very little is known about how habitat and resources are shared by these predators intra- and inter-specifically. Here we use long-term (over 3 yr) passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the patterns of activity, space use and associative behaviour at an isolated, small shallow seamount. By quantifying fine-scale spatiotemporal overlaps and performing null model randomization tests, we found evidence of non-random associations, mostly between conspecifics of both species, as well as shifts in diel and seasonal patterns of space occupancy. Both species were detected more often during spring, and appear to be more active during daytime, suggesting the absence of fine-scale temporal habitat partitioning. Additionally, we found evidence of size-dependent spatial behaviour in almaco jack, with similarly sized individuals co-occurring more often and larger specimens being more infrequently detected. This study quantitatively assesses individual associations using solely presence-absence data collected through passive acoustic telemetry, showing the potential of this approach in a broader application to a significant number of past and ongoing studies, even if many were not originally designed to study this important aspect of fish ecology.","[Gandra, Miguel] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res IMAR, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge] Univ Azores, OKEANOS UAc, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores,"Gandra, M (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",m3gandra@gmail.com,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Gandra, Miguel/0000-0003-1506-5141; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589","project MARMACII [INTERREG/05/MAC/4.2/A4]; project SEAMOV [PTDC/MAR/1082 32/2008]; project MoniZEC [DRCT/0281M2.1.2/I/018/2011]; FCT/MCTES; DRCT Reequipamento programs; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UID/MAR/04292/2013, IF/01640/2015, SFRH/BPD/66532/2009]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/66532/2009] Funding Source: FCT",project MARMACII; project SEAMOV; project MoniZEC; FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); DRCT Reequipamento programs; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank T.

The first experiment was conducted to understand the deployment procedures of an acoustic telemetry system and determine the appropriate deployment of receivers' spacing, while the second experiment was conducted to quantify the site fidelity and habitat use of 11 reef fish in the Fangchenggang artificial reef area in the northern South China Sea, China. The results indicated that the logistic regression model was an effective way to balance the detection probability at different distances between the range test transmitter and receiver, with above 50% detection probability within 240 m and 80% detection probability within 110 m. The residency index, as a quantification of site fidelity, was 0.85 +/- 0.24. The 100% minimum convex polygon, 95% kernel utilization distribution, and 50% kernel utilization distribution, which are the indicators of habitat use, were 34,522.94 +/- 35,548.95, 1,467.52 +/- 1,619.05, and 236.01 +/- 294.59 m(2), respectively. High site fidelity and the small spatial scale of habitat use for reef fish demonstrated that artificial reefs were an effective man-made structure to attract fish. Overall, this study supports the feasibility of the acoustic telemetry system, indicating that it provides a good approach for quantifying the associations between artificial reefs and fish.","[Lyu, Shaoliang; Lauden, Hagai Nsobi; Lin, Kun; Wang, Xuefeng] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Fisheries, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lifei] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Biol Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Chen, Guobao] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, South China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guobao] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Sci Observing & Expt Stn South China Sea Fishery R, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhichao] State Ocean Adm, South China Sea Stand & Metrol Ctr, Guangzhou, Peoples R China","Guangdong Ocean University; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; South China Sea Fisheries Research Institute, CAFS; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs","Wang, XF (corresponding author), Guangdong Ocean Univ, Coll Fisheries, Zhanjiang, Peoples R China.",xuefeng1999@126.com,"LYU, Shaoliang/S-3773-2016; Wang, Xuefeng/G-1663-2011; Wang, Lifei/AAB-4708-2020","Wang, Lifei/0000-0003-2530-6703; LYU, Shaoliang/0000-0002-8778-1625",,,,,58,0,0,0,12,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Twenty-five sheeps-head (Archosargus probatocephalus), 28 gray snapper (Lutjanus griseus), and 29 green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) were tagged, with movements monitored for a period of up to 4 months using an array of passive acoustic receivers. Baseline residency was examined for fish and sea turtles before, during, and after the test event. No mortality of tagged fish or sea turtles was evident from the sonar test event. There was a significant increase in the daily residency index for both sheepshead and gray snapper at the testing wharf subsequent to the event.

Range testing and visual observations revealed the limitations of using small acoustic transmitters to monitor movements of small coral reef fish in a topographically complex and noisy coral reef environment. Visual observations of conventionally tagged and albino fish suggest individuals return each day to forage over the same few hundred m(2) of shallow, turf algae dominated boulder and reef flat habitat for periods of at least weeks to months. Acoustic telemetry data suggest lower frequency of repeated use of daytime foraging, nighttime refuge and sunset spawning sites. However, integration of observation and acoustic telemetry data revealed that many fish were not detected while they were within the empirically tested range of the receivers. These observations indicate that data from passive acoustic telemetry can underestimate the frequency and duration of repeated use of specific areas. Yellow tang adults made daily crepuscular migrations of up to 600 m between foraging and spawning or sheltering sites at consistent times relative to sunset and sunrise. While there was high individual variability in migration distance, almost all individuals moved in the same direction (from south to north) at sunset. This study provided valuable information for evaluating ongoing fishery management efforts using marine protected areas in Hawaii.","[Claisse, Jeremy T.; Clark, Timothy B.; Schumacher, Brett D.; McTee, Sarah A.; Bushnell, Megan E.; Parrish, James D.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Zool, Hawaii Cooperat Fishery Res Unit, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Callan, Chatham K.; Laidley, Charles W.] Ocean Inst, Finfish Dept, Waimanalo, HI 96795 USA",University of Hawaii System,"Claisse, JT (corresponding author), Occidental Coll, Vantuna Res Grp, 1600 Campus Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90041 USA.",claisse@oxy.edu,"Claisse, Jeremy/B-8622-2012","Callan, Chatham/0000-0003-2138-6240","Hawaii's Fisheries Local Action Strategy through Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources Coral Management; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Science [NA03NOS4260044, NA04NOS4260172, NA160A2412]; University of Hawaii [R/FM-20]; NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce [NA05OAR4171048]; Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources; NSF","Hawaii's Fisheries Local Action Strategy through Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources Coral Management; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Science(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of Hawaii; NOAA Office of Sea Grant, Department of Commerce(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF))","This research was supported in part through a grant from Hawaii's Fisheries Local Action Strategy through Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources Coral Management funding.

An alternative is to protect essential habitats, such as spawning grounds, especially if these are stable over time. We studied the movements and habitat use patterns of white trevally Pseudocaranx dentex (Carangidae), a commercially important species, to assist in the design of marine reserves. Diel, seasonal and inter-annual movements of trevally were studied using active acoustic tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-release in the Faial Channel, Azores Islands. White trevally were captured at inshore and offshore reefs. Inshore trevally moved daily alongshore, using large activity spaces, while the short-term movements of offshore trevally were restricted to the reef summits. During the summer spawning season, both groups displayed frequent migrations of up to several kilometres, but inshore fish remained inshore, whereas offshore reef fish expanded their range to include visits to inshore sites. This behaviour eventually resulted in low long-term residence within the study area, especially that of inshore fish. During the spawning season, one inshore site was visited by most of the fish. However, instead of gathering in large aggregations at a single location, it appears that the trevally adopted a multiple-site visiting behaviour, which may increase mating opportunities through mixing between inshore and offshore fish that are otherwise segregated for most of the year. Protection of spawning biomass and sites for this species seems potentially feasible, but this would require protecting a suite of sites per island. Furthermore, because fish would not be fully protected under this scenario, we argue that such spatial management measures need to be accompanied by conventional fishing-effort control measures applied to all local populations.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589","FCT/MCTES [SFRH/BD/11132/2002, SFRH/ BD/12788/2003]; Associated Laboratory ISR; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/12788/2003, SFRH/BD/11132/2002] Funding Source: FCT",FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Associated Laboratory ISR; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We sincerely thank A.

A comprehensive array of acoustic receivers was deployed at two near-shore coastal sites in south-eastern Australia, to examine the movements, activity-space size and residency of a temperate rocky-reef, herbivorous species Girella elevata. Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure. The results from the present study will further contribute to the spatial information required in the zoning of effective marine protected areas, and our understanding of temperate reef fish ecology.","[Stocks, Jerom R.; Gray, Charles A.; Taylor, Matthew D.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stocks, Jerom R.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Batemans Bay Fisheries Ctr, Batemans Bay, NSW 2536, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW 2316, Australia; [Gray, Charles A.] WildFish Res, Sydney, NSW 2232, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Stocks, JR (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jerom.stocks@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Stocks, Jerom/N-9315-2016","Gray, Charles/0000-0001-9939-9995; Stocks, Jerom/0000-0001-6425-8869",Integrated Marine Observing System; Australian Animal Tagging and Monitoring System; NSW Saltwater Recreational Fishing Trust; Fisheries NSW; University of NSW,Integrated Marine Observing System; Australian Animal Tagging and Monitoring System; NSW Saltwater Recreational Fishing Trust; Fisheries NSW; University of NSW,"We thank personnel from the University of New South Wales and Fisheries NSW who provided technical advice, including Dylan Van der Meulen and Nicholas Payne.

We used manual acoustic telemetry coupled with global positioning technology to track the detailed spatially explicit daily movements (24 h) of multiple individuals of two common Caribbean fish species, Haemulon sciurus (bluestriped grunt) and Lutjanus apodus (schoolmaster snapper). Movement pathways and day and night activity spaces were mapped and quantified in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Directional sun-synchronous migrations occurred close to astronomical sunset and sunrise. Site fidelity within day and night activity spaces was high. Nine of twelve individuals exhibited overlap of day and night activity spaces and three fish (L. apodus) exhibited complete spatial segregation. Night activity spaces (H. sciurus: 11,309 +/- 3,548 m(2); L. apodus: 9,950 +/- 3,120 m(2)) were significantly larger than day activity spaces (H. sciurus: 2,778 +/- 1,979 m(2); L. apodus: 1,291 +/- 636 m(2)). The distance between sequential position fixes (step lengths) was significantly greater at night than day, indicative of nocturnal foraging and day resting behavior. Integrating acoustic telemetry, GIS techniques and spatial statistics to study fish movement behavior revealed both individual variability and some broader generality in movement paths and activity spaces suggestive of complex underlying behavioral mechanisms influencing diel movements.","[Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] NOAA NOS NCCOS CCMA, Biogeog Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Brown, Kerry A.] Kingston Univ London, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 1LQ, Surrey, England",University of the Virgin Islands; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Kingston University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Brown, Kerry/U-5082-2019","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970; BROWN, KERRY/0000-0002-6342-8966",NOAA; University of the Virgin Islands,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of the Virgin Islands,"This research was supported by a NOAA cooperative agreement with the University of the Virgin Islands.

In the Seychelles, FSAs of this species occur monthly between September and June around the full moon. To study the spawning aggregation dynamics of S. sutor, 39 reproductively active individuals were acoustically tagged and monitored at 3 known FSA sites (Pate Polite, Pate Desire and Pate Dividi) off the west coast of Praslin island (Seychelles) between October 2010 and April 2011. The presence and absence of tagged fish at the 3 sites were monitored using moored arrays of passive acoustic receivers, while the density of fish at the FSAs was quantified using underwater visual census (UVC). Most tagged fish (87.0%) detected in more than 1 spawning period showed fidelity to single spawning sites. Predominantly, tagged individuals arrived at FSA sites at dawn and departed at dusk. Spawning residency times at FSA sites ranged from 0.02 to 16.1 d. At Pate Polite, residency times were higher in the first half of the spawning season. Residency times were often several-fold shorter than aggregation duration which, when combined with patterns in arrival and departure times, indicates high turnover of fish within aggregations. The findings of this study provide information needed for emerging co-management schemes that aim to sustain this socio-economically important fishery.","[Bijoux, Jude P.; Dagorn, Laurent] IRD, UMR 212, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Berke, Gregory; Robinson, Jan] Seychelles Fishing Author, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Cowley, Paul D.] S African Inst Aquat Biodivers, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Soria, Marc] IRD, UMR 212, St Denis, Reunion, France; [Gaertner, Jean-Claude] IFREMER, UPF IRD ILM, UMR 241 EIO, Faaa, Tahiti, France; [Robinson, Jan] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Ifremer; James Cook University,"Bijoux, JP (corresponding author), IRD, UMR 212, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.",jude.bijoux@ird.fr,"Dagorn, Laurent/K-1002-2016; Cowley, Paul/M-4264-2017","Cowley, Paul/0000-0003-1246-4390",Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) [MASMA/OR/2008/06]; Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP) [SEY/SGP/OP4/Y3/RAF/2010/05]; Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) through the European Union (EU) of the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Protocols under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (IRD-DSF),Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA); Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP); Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) through the European Union (EU) of the EU/Seychelles Fisheries Protocols under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement Departement Soutien et Formation des communautes scientifiques du Sud (IRD-DSF),This work was supported through grants from the Marine and Coastal Science for Management (MASMA) program (Grant No. MASMA/OR/2008/06) of the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) and from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Small Grant Program (SGP) to the Praslin Fishers Association (PFA) (Grant No. SEY/SGP/OP4/Y3/RAF/2010/05).

Between August 2010 and September 2012, we used acoustic telemetry to continuously monitor movements of 31 Lutjanus argentiventris (yellow snapper) and 25 Mycteroperca rosacea (leopard grouper) at Los Islotes, a small no-take reserve and reported spawning site for both species in the SW Gulf of California. Though the majority of fish from both species exhibited moderate levels of site fidelity to Los Islotes (snapper: present 49 +/- 30% of days since tagging, grouper: 64 +/- 30%), cluster analyses revealed multiple patterns of site fidelity within species. Approximately 30% of snapper exhibited decreases in site fidelity during the spawning season, and snapper did not spawn at the reserve during the study. Grouper spawning aggregations at Los Islotes were visually observed in 2011 and 2012, though the abundance of fish and the intensity of courtship behaviors were reduced in comparison with reported aggregations elsewhere in the Gulf. Three snapper and 2 grouper made repeated movements across pelagic waters between Los Islotes and Marisla Seamount, another documented aggregation site in the SW Gulf. The demonstrated variation in movements of these species over multiple temporal and spatial scales warrants consideration of movement patterns in assessments of reserve performance, as well as the combination of traditional fisheries regulations (e.g. size limits) with marine reserves throughout the Gulf.","[TinHan, Thomas; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA; [Erisman, Brad; Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weaver, Amy; Vazquez-Arce, Daniel] Sociedad Hist Nat Niparaja AC, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"TinHan, T (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA.",t.tinhan@gmail.com,"Erisman, Brad/P-1640-2019","Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio/0000-0002-8173-1432; TinHan, Thomas/0000-0002-5610-7718",Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture [DGOPA-05356-140710-3457],Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture,"We thank 3 anonymous reviewers for their help in improving the manuscript.

Twelve adults were caught along the north-eastern coast of a small Mediterranean island, tagged with acoustic transmitters and released within or just outside the integral reserve. Fish detected, during both the seasons showed strong fidelity for the study area before and during the spawning season and their home range did not differ between seasons. Home ranges reached an asymptote between 12 and 174 days after release. Home range estimated by kernel utilization distributions ranged from 9,876 to 89,914 m(2), with core areas of 946 to 7,274 m(2). Temporal patterns frequently showed a dominant diel rhythm with most of detections occurring at daytime, independently of season. The variability in the movement patterns of D. vulgaris was lower between seasons (i.e., during and outside the spawning season) than at smaller temporal scale (i.e., between day and night) and was largely affected by inter-individual differences.

Four commercial fish species (Epinephelus maculatus, Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus microrhinos, and Scarus ghobban) were studied for 17 months (45 fish). Nine fish (20%) were detected on reefs other than the reef onto which they were released. Four patterns of inter-reef movement were identified during the survey, including home range relocations, movements larger than the scale of the study, many inter-reef movements within the study area, and punctual excursions outside the daily home range. The information gathered in this study demonstrates the ability of the fish to carry out medium-scale movements in a fragmented habitat. Consequently, the effectiveness of the reserve to protect the entire population is probably limited for these species. Because all the identified patterns implied at least one movement across the reserve boundaries, our results support the hypothesis that the Laregnere Marine Reserve, part of the South Lagoon Marine Park, could benefit the adjacent fished area through spillover.","[Chateau, Olivier; Wantiez, Laurent] LIVE Univ New Caledonia, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia",,"Wantiez, L (corresponding author), LIVE Univ New Caledonia, BP R4, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia.",wantiez@univ-nc.nc,"Wantiez, Laurent/L-3343-2013","Wantiez, Laurent/0000-0001-5024-2057",,,,,32,56,68,4,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

Whereas the majority of seabass left the area in winter, 13 seabass stayed in the harbour experiencing temperatures as low as 2.8 & DEG;C. Two groups of seabass were identified having different core movement areas in the inner and outer harbours, although movement between the two areas was possible. The distinct differences in habitat use between these groups resulted in a significantly different level of exposure to fisheries under the same policy framework.

The Republic of Palau recently created the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, a Marine Managed Area that was intended to conserve marine resources and enhance local pelagic fisheries. However, the capacity of the nation's domestic fishery to exploit pelagic species must be built to meet these objectives and, to this aim, the development of a coastal network of Fish Attracting Devices (FADs) has been proposed. To inform the development of the nation's FAD program, we used acoustic telemetry to study the movements of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) within Palau's existing FAD network. Subadult yellowfin tuna (50 - 79 cm FL) remained within the FAD network for up to 175 days and young-of-the-year yellowfin tuna spent significantly more time in association with FADs in comparison to year-1 fish. A network analysis suggests that the Ngardmau and Peleliu FADs were the most important components of the current FAD network, and a mixed effects Poisson generalized linear model indicated that the residency of yellowfin tuna to these FADs was significantly related to mooring depth and distance from the reef. These results provide a description of yellowfin tuna movements within Palau's FAD network and recommendations to improve the nation's FAD program that are also applicable to other Pacific Island nations and territories that desire to improve domestic access to pelagic fish stocks.","[Filous, Alexander; Mereb, Geory; Golbuu, Yimnang] Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror, Palau; [Filous, Alexander; Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA; [Griffin, Lucas; Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Lennox, Robert J.] Norwegian Res Ctr NORCE, Lab Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Bergen, Norway",University of Hawaii System; National Geographic Society; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE),"Filous, A (corresponding author), Palau Int Coral Reef Ctr, Koror, Palau.",afilous@hawaii.edu,,"Griffin, Lucas/0000-0002-8560-0683; Lennox, Robert/0000-0003-1010-0577; Danylchuk, Andy/0000-0002-8363-0782","Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea; Palau International Coral Reef Center; National Geographic Pristine Seas program","Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea; Palau International Coral Reef Center; National Geographic Pristine Seas program(National Geographic Society)","This study was funded by the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea, the Palau International Coral Reef Center, and the National Geographic Pristine Seas program.

Telemetry confirmed the use of common reproductive migratory corridors and significant sex-specific variations in residency at the FSA. Combined underwater visual census and telemetry data verified a 3-month peak aggregation period, with aggregations forming and persisting over ca. 12 days prior to full moon between January and May. FSA formation coincided with seasonally low and relatively stable seawater temperatures. Some males frequented the FSA site during each aggregation month over two consecutive years. Conversely, most females were present at the FSA during only a single aggregation period, with the month of visitation consistent among years. Nearly two-thirds of tagged fish were relocated or recaptured within 11 km of the aggregation site, with a maximum detected distance of 26 km and a minimum estimated catchment area of 100-175 km(2).

Copper rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and lingcod (Ophiodon enlongatus) are dominant members of the typical reef fish community that inhabit rocky and high-relief substrates along the Pacific Northwest. We used acoustic telemetry to document their residency and movements in the nearshore waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska in order to assess use of created reef habitat in an individual-based manner. A total of 57 fish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Forty-five fish were captured and monitored in three habitats: artificial reef, low-relief natural reef, and patchy high-relief natural reef. Within each habitat, both rockfish and lingcod exhibited long periods of residency with limited movements. Twelve rockfish were captured at the natural reefs and displaced a distance of 4.0 km to the artificial reef. Five of the 12 rockfish returned within 10 d of their release to their initial capture site. Another five of the 12 displaced fish established residency at the artificial reef through the duration of our study.

Traditionally, stock assessments measure reproductive potential as spawning stock biomass or egg production and do not include other aspects of reproductive behavior. Red drum make an excellent case study to assess these other aspects, as (1) they are highly fecund, pelagic spawners, like most exploited marine fishes; (2) their life cycle is delineated between nursery (estuarine) and adult (coastal and offshore) habitat; and (3) they are managed at these two spatial scales. This study was conducted from August 2012 to December 2013 and integrates data from multiple methods and spatial scales. Aerial surveys were used for large-scale monitoring of aggregations off two known estuarine nursery areas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, USA. Capture-based sampling in Tampa Bay coastal (n = 2581) and estuarine waters (n = 158) was used to assess reproductive state and to confirm coastal spawning. To assess spatial dynamics, we acoustically tagged two population components in the Tampa Bay system, subadults from the estuary (n = 20) and adults from the coastal spawning site (n = 60). Behavioral plasticity was seen in subadult recruitment to coastal habitat, with some subadults maturing and recruiting before or during the spawning season and others (14 of 20 acoustically tagged fish) recruiting at the end of the 2012 spawning season. Both adults and recruited subadults (n = 29) were consequently detected in the Charlotte Harbor array, 132 km to the south. Spawning-site fidelity to the Tampa Bay spawning site occurred at both the population and individual scales. Aggregations consistently occurred in Tampa Bay coastal waters during the spawning season, and approximately two-thirds of tagged adults returned in the 2013 spawning season. A similar proportion of subadults returned to the Tampa Bay spawning site, exhibiting natal homing. However, these first-time spawners arrived later than repeat spawners and were detected over shorter time periods. This study, and others like it, demonstrates how integrating data from individuals tracked over space and time with more traditional population-based sampling is changing our understanding of ecological processes that affect marine fish productivity and our ability to manage for sustainablity.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Burnsed, Sarah L.

If individuals inside reserves behave differently to those outside, this information should be incorporated into reserve design and in management efforts to avoid the selective removal of certain behaviors. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, north-eastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types. One group had uni-modal home ranges that on average encompassed c.900 m linear distance. All nine residential snapper from the reserve displayed this behavior, as well as five of ten residential fish from the non-reserve area. The second group (five fish, all from the non-reserve area) had home ranges with two separate modes (bi-modal home ranges), which on average encompassed c.2 100 m linear distance. We suggest that some aspect of the marine reserve environment encourages extreme residency by either the modification of individual behaviors or through the removal of selective exploitation. If true this suggests that reserves and populations of exploited animals may become dependent on the life history characteristics of the individuals they encourage or select for.

The eastern blue groper, Achoerodus viridis, is a long-lived, protogynous hermaphrodite, and an iconic' marine species in eastern Australia, with several MPAs having been established specifically for their protection. Site fidelity, habitat use, and home range size were assessed for 29 adult eastern blue gropers monitored for up to 374days using passive acoustic telemetry within and around a small marine reserve. The fish exhibited long residency times and no movement was recorded between adjacent reefs, suggesting sand acts as a natural barrier to movement. Core ranges were calculated using 50% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) and estimated between 0.005 and 0.092km(2). Males had larger core ranges than females or fish of indeterminate sex. There was no statistical difference between the breeding/non-breeding seasons. Home ranges were calculated using 95% KUD and ranged between 0.03 and 0.54km(2). Home range size was largest for males and significantly larger for all sexes in the breeding season. Fish tagged in the no-take' area of the MPA had smaller home ranges than fish tagged in the area where fishing is permitted. This study indicates that even relatively small MPAs can provide effective protection for adult eastern blue groper, supporting the proposition that large reef dwellers with long residency times can be used as flagship species to gain public support for the designation of MPAs.

Acoustic monitoring studies indicate that olive rockfish are highly residential and that black rockfish are capable of long migrations and have less site fidelity; yet little is known about the long-term movements of blue rockfish. External tag-recapture studies indicate that blue rockfish may have intermediate movements relative to these congener nearshore species. To better understand the site fidelity, and daily and seasonal movements of blue rockfish over long (>1-year) time scales, we placed acoustic transmitters into 21 adult blue rockfish (30-41 cm total length) in Carmel Bay, California. Blue rockfish displayed intermediate movement patterns and residency relative to other similar kelp forest rockfish species. Two-thirds of tagged blue rockfish (13 fish) exhibited high residency to the study area (>12 mo). When in residence, mean home range of blue rockfish was 0.23 km(2), however as many as 30% of tagged blue rockfish shifted their core home range area during the study. Most shifts in home range occurred during upwelling season, and tagged fish moved up to 3.1 km when in residence. Blue rockfish with short residence times were last detected in the study area in late winter and early spring. Blue rockfish were observed at shallower depths during day than night, likely indicative of diurnal feeding. However, over longer time scales, blue rockfish were detected at deeper depths during upwelling periods and with increased wave heights. Daily and seasonal vertical movements of blue rockfish may be influenced by upwelling conditions and local prey abundance.","[Green, Kristen M.] Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Sitka, AK 99835 USA; [Greenley, Ashley P.] Fishwise, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Starr, Richard M.] Univ Calif, Sea Grant Extens Program, Moss Landing, CA USA",Alaska Department of Fish & Game,"Green, KM (corresponding author), Alaska Dept Fish & Game, Sitka, AK 99835 USA.",kristen.green@alaska.gov,,"Green, Kristen/0000-0001-8684-0884",California Sea Grant College Program,California Sea Grant College Program,"Funding for this study was provided by the California Sea Grant College Program (http://www-csgc.ucsd.edu/).

Leopard coralgrouper Plectropomus leopardus is one of the main targeted fishery species in the Great Barrier Reef; however, there is no information on long-term movement patterns based on continuous and frequent data points. The objective of this study was to determine long-term space use of P. leopardus and identify any seasonal variation in movement trends. A total of 124 P. leopardus were implanted with V13P acoustic transmitters between 2010 and 2012 and passively tracked. Forty-five VR2W receivers were deployed at 2 reefs to track the movements of tagged individuals. The influence of time of day, season, tagging year, location, and water temperature on several movement measures was investigated. Of the 124 fish tagged, 74 individuals had sufficient detections to be included in analysis of horizontal movement, and 55 were used to analyse vertical movements. Results showed increased horizontal movements and higher activity in deeper water during the day in the austral summer. Movement patterns, both vertically and horizontally, appeared to be influenced by water temperature, but also corresponded with spawning season. Despite increased movements during summer, individuals typically remained in a small area similar to 0.5 km(2) throughout detection periods, indicating that long-range spawning-related movements are rare and that adequate resources are obtained within a small section of habitat year-round. This study provides long-term (similar to 3 yr) movement data for an economically significant reef fish and increases knowledge of spatial and temporal space use patterns.","[Matley, J.

We used a 300 km long passive acoustic telemetry network to measure site fidelity and dispersal distances of adult red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) tagged within two estuarine no-take zones at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. Seventy-eight tagged fish were tracked an average of 549 days with some individuals followed for over four years. Fish spent most of their total time at liberty inside no-take zones with a mean residency of 125-178 consecutive days after release, and 67%-95% of their total time, depending on species. Sixty-four individuals (82%) also utilized adjacent public waters, dispersing up to 650 km, although dispersal rates averaged less than 0.10 km day(-1) for all three species. Red drum and black drum movements across reserve boundaries were clearly bi-directional with individuals averaging 4 and 30 excursions per year, respectively, into fished areas. Both species spent more time outside reserve boundaries during their reproductive periods, suggesting that these no-take zones protect individuals that subsequently spawn over a wider geographic area. Our findings demonstrate that coastal marine reserves have the potential to provide substantial protection for highly mobile non-reef fishes. They further suggest that reserves designed to safeguard fish during non-reproductive periods may be most practical for estuarine species whose home ranges increase during spawning seasons.

However, the extent to which these benefits occur is dependent on movement patterns of fish, for which there is a paucity of data, particularly for coral reef species. Eleven adult Kyphosus sectatrix were tracked [five in the Grand Caille marine reserve (MR) and six in the Petit Piton MR within the Soufriere Marine Management Area, St Lucia] from February to April 1999, using acoustic telemetry. Average number of days over which fish were tracked was 21.5 (range 5-51). Home range size of individuals, temporal use of space within the home range, and permeability of MR and habitat boundaries to fish movement were examined. Average minimum home range area of K. sectatrix was not significantly different between Grand Caille (30 514 m(2)) and Petit Piton (39 114 m(2)). However, the shape of home ranges was conspicuously different between the sites and reflected available reef shape, Individual home ranges overlapped strongly with those of other individuals at the same site, and use of space within the home range was generally restricted to a small number of preferred sites. Preferred sites were often shared among individuals and tended to be occupied at a specific time of day, with some sites were preferred in the morning and or afternoon, whilst others preferred during the middle of the day. Fidelity to a single sleeping-shelter site was high at night. MR boundaries over contiguous reef at Grand Caille were frequently crossed with individuals spending, on average, 63% of their time (range 37-94) outside the MR. This demonstrates the need for the MR boundary at this site to be implemented farther offshore to encompass the reef, if the MR is to better protect K sectatrix. At Petit Piton, where MR boundaries effectively encompass available reef, K sectatrix spent, on average, only 11% of their time (range 0-40) outside the protected area. At Grand Caille boundaries were crossed more readily (individuals spent an average of 18% of their time off reef) than at Petit Piton where individuals spent an average of 0.7% of their time off reef.

However, fine-scale movements and use of artificial reefs by red snapper over diel periods is unclear. Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550-745 mm TL; n = 12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100 m, with 75% of locations within 30 m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean = 27.5 m, SD = 7.1) than day (mean = 19.1 m, SD = 8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332-958d based on passive acoustic monitoring.

We used acoustic telemetry to quantify the movements of giant trevally, a large coral reef top predator, at 5 atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. We did not observe any inter-atoll movements but found that giant trevally were attached to core activity areas from which they made periodic atoll-wide excursions of up to 29 km. Within the core areas, the tagged fish exhibited diel habitat shifts. We identified Rapture Reef at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll as a spawning site, where giant trevally form seasonal mating aggregations. Giant trevally that use Rapture Reef as their core daytime area live there year-round, whereas those that occupy other areas of FFS migrate to Rapture Reef in the summertime during specific phases of the moon. Although giant trevally were wide-ranging and would require large marine protected areas (e.g. entire atolls or islands) to protect their entire range, core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally could be contained within relatively small marine protected areas. Identification of spawning sites could assist in the establishment of focused marine protected areas that, while quite small in size, could have significant impact in preserving the spawning biomass of this species. Very large marine protected areas are not feasible in most heavily populated areas, hence effective alternative management strategies must be found for this tishery-targeted, wide-ranging top predator. We suggest using a combination of relatively small marine protected areas, to protect core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally, and conventional measures such as minimum size or 'slot' limits to further safeguard spawning stocks.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,40,125,143,1,60,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

From 1984 to 2016, a total of 3 430 C. nasutus (178-980 mm fork length) were tagged (with small plastic dart tags) throughout the species' distributional range, with an overall reported recapture rate of 7.2%. Recaptured individuals displayed high levels of residency, moving an average of 14.8 km, with time-at-liberty ranging from 0 to 6 809 days. The majority of recaptures (84.6%) were made within 1 km of the tagging sites; however, some large-scale movements, of up to 528 km, were recorded. Although C. nasutus individuals moving greater distances were characterised by greater mean sizes (mm fork length) at time of recapture, the distances moved by juveniles were not significantly different from those of adults (p > 0.05). Low levels of connectivity among coastal regions were therefore expected due to the high degree of residency displayed by this species. Combining traditional management approaches together with a well-designed network of no-take marine protected areas is likely to be the most effective way to protect this vulnerable species. A lack of data on the movements of adults remains a challenge, but this could be overcome by tracking large individuals tagged with long-life acoustic transmitters.","[Murray, T. S.; Cowley, P.

In two successive years, we surgically implanted transmitters in male and female bonefish (n = 60) and examined their movement patterns within the array. Eight bonefish surgically implanted with transmitters as part of an earlier study were also tracked. In 2009, the telemetry information was complemented with snorkeling observations, underwater video, and manual tracking of the same acoustically tagged fish, as well as fish (n = 3) gastrically implanted with continuous transmitters. During a period of 4-7 days spanning the full and new moons, primarily between October and May, bonefish moved from their typical shallow flats and aggregated at sites in close proximity to the deep water drop-off of the Exuma Sound. Localized movements of the large schools of bonefish (often > 1,000 fish) at these presumptive pre-spawning aggregation sites included brief trips (< 8 h) just after sunset until just prior to sunrise to the abyssal wall at the edge of the Exuma Sound (i.e., > 1,000 m depth). Tagged bonefish detected at these aggregation sites were subsequently detected back in the tidal creeks and coastal flats shortly after new and full moons and remained at these more typical shallow sites (i.e., < 2 m depth). Although we did not directly observe spawning events, we did observe ventral nudging and porpoising behaviors, which are potentially associated with courtship. Timing of the observed movements and possible courtship behaviors was coincident with periods when gametes were well developed. Collectively, our study provides the first objective evidence suggesting that the aggregation and seasonal migration of bonefish to deep shelf environments during certain moon phases is for spawning.","[Danylchuk, Andy J.; Haak, Christopher R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Danylchuk, Andy J.; Cooke, Steven J.; Goldberg, Tony L.; Suski, Cory D.; Murchie, Karen J.; Danylchuk, Sascha E.; Shultz, Aaron D.; Haak, Christopher R.; Brooks, Edd J.; Oronti, Annabelle; Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Flats Ecol & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Cooke, Steven J.; Murchie, Karen J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Suski, Cory D.; Shultz, Aaron D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Brooks, Edd J.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Carleton University; Carleton University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Plymouth; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Danylchuk, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 311 Holdsworth Hall,160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",danylchuk@eco.umass.edu,"Brooks, Edward/G-4697-2011; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010","Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X","Bonefish and Tarpon Trust; Patagonia's World Trout Initiative; Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation; Baldwin Foundation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Carleton University; Cape Eleuthera Foundation; University of Illinois; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CGSD; Bahamas Department of Marine Resources; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture; Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and Department of Environmental Conservation [MAS00987]","Bonefish and Tarpon Trust; Patagonia's World Trout Initiative; Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation; Baldwin Foundation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Carleton University; Cape Eleuthera Foundation; University of Illinois; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CGSD(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Bahamas Department of Marine Resources; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and Department of Environmental Conservation","We gratefully acknowledge the staff, students, and volunteers of the Cape Eleuthera Institute and The Island School for logistical support and assistance with fieldwork, and in particular S.

This study investigates area utilisation and activity patterns of 13 adult roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae) using telemetry and underwater observations. Acoustic transmitters implanted into C. laticeps in tanks had no apparent effects on growth and mobility. Natural behaviour of the treated fish in the field was verified by SCUBA divers. Manual boat- and diver-based tracking was carried out inside the Castle Rock MPA, False Bay, South Africa, over a 17-month period. A radio acoustic positioning system (VRAP, VEMCO Ltd) was used to record automatically fish positions over two 1-month periods during and after the spawning season of roman. Manually recorded fish positions and VRAP positions inside the triangle of buoys within the system were accurate within 10m; deviations increased with increased distance of the fish from the centre of the system and during unfavourable sea conditions. Analysis of movement data using a 95% fixed kernel algorithm suggests that roman occupy small home ranges of between 1 000m(2) and 3 000m(2), which shows that this species is well suited for protection in small MPAs. Interestingly, the home range size did not seem to be related to fish size or habitat quality. Swimming activity decreased at night. During periods of cold-water upwelling, fish retreated into caves. During the spawning season, females extended their home ranges, which result in a 'spill over' effect of adult fish into fishing areas.","Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa; Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Kerwath, SE (corresponding author), Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, Private Bag X2, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa.",skerwath@deat.gov.za,"Sauer, Warwick/GJI-2267-2022","Sauer, Warwick/0000-0002-9756-1757; Attwood, Colin/0000-0002-1045-3439; Kerwath, Sven/0000-0003-2751-5015",,,,,40,35,38,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1814-232X,1814-2338,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

Known for forming large spawning aggregations, numbering tens of thousands, they are now listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Recently, the only Nassau grouper spawning aggregation in Puerto Rico was documented at Bajo de Sico, a seamount and seasonally closed marine protected area.Studies elsewhere on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Nassau grouper aggregations have documented how, and how far, fish move from home sites to the spawning site, and have shown the tight link between aggregation formation and the lunar cycle. However, these studies have not evaluated the potential impacts of the reduced spatial extent represented by a seamount, nor have they addressed the impacts of local seasonal protection relative to the size of the closed area and the timing of aggregation formation.Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of Nassau grouper spawning aggregation formation at Bajo de Sico. Twenty-six individuals were tagged and tracked over three consecutive spawning seasons.Nassau grouper formed three or four aggregations per season, corresponding to the lunar cycles from January to April. Individuals displayed high visitation rates to the aggregation site: 98% visited at least two peaks per season; 80% visited multiple seasons. The timing of arrival, departure, and residency at the site were significantly different among individuals and lunar months, indicating significant variability in aggregation formation. Nassau grouper occupied a relatively small staging area (2.7 km(2)) and courtship arena (0.67 km(2)) compared with aggregations occurring on continental/insular platforms or large atolls; movements off the seamount may occur but were not detected. Results indicate the current seasonal closure inadequately protects the spawning population on Bajo de Sico and should be extended to the end of June.","[Tuohy, Evan; Scharer-Umpierre, Michelle; Appeldoorn, Richard] Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA; [Penrod, Louis] Florida Inst Technol, Dept Ocean Engn & Marine Sci, Melbourne, FL USA",University of Puerto Rico; University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez; Florida Institute of Technology,"Tuohy, E (corresponding author), Univ Puerto Rico, Dept Marine Sci, Mayaguez, PR 00681 USA.",evan.tuohy@upr.edu,,,"National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA15NMF4270341]; Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (CFMC); Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI)","National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (CFMC); Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI)","National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,Grant/Award Number: NA15NMF4270341;Caribbean Fisheries Management Council (CFMC); Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI)",,48,0,0,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

However, to benefit local fisheries through spillover, the species in the reserves must also be able to migrate to unprotected areas. We evaluated the optimal design of marine reserves for protecting and promoting spillover of a commercially important parrotfish, Sparisoma cretense (Linnaeus, 1758), by empirically quantifying short- and long-term movements of individuals originally captured inside and outside a small reserve in the Azores Islands (mid-Atlantic). Movements were quantified using active tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-recapture. We found that the dual social organization of the species determined the individuals' movements and habitat use. Haremic fish occupied small HRs associated with permanently established male territories in high energy reef areas. Group (schooling) fish spent most of their time in sheltered reefs but expanded their HRs during the spawning season with daily migrations to the 'territorial' areas. S. cretense HR sizes were considerably larger than those previously reported for tropical parrotfishes. Passive acoustic monitoring indicated very high site fidelity and minimal dispersion for up to 30 mo. This study demonstrates that residency of adult parrotfish can last for years. Several individuals emigrated to the reserve from neighbouring areas and some of them relocated thereafter. We suggest that a network of adequately enforced marine reserves of small to medium size (ca. 1 to 5 km(2)) containing suitable habitat diversity can effectively protect core populations of S. cretense, but benefits to adjacent fisheries through spillover will be limited to the areas adjacent to the reserve boundaries.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589",,,,,31,96,110,0,38,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This includes the optimal design of networks of marine reserves, as movements of fish are a major determinant for the reserve effect (increase in size and number inside reserves) and spillover effect (emigration from reserves). The increasing use of acoustic telemetry techniques, particularly passive acoustic arrays, is providing much of that information, but studies have typically used one specific approach at a specific spatial-temporal scale. We studied movement patterns, habitat use and dispersal in the red porgy, Pagrus pagrus (a commercially important species) in the Azores islands, mid-north Atlantic, with the aim of supporting the design of marine reserves that would protect local populations while enhancing fisheries. Movements were quantified using: (1) short-term active acoustic tracking; (2) multi-year passive acoustic monitoring; and (3) standard tag-release experiments in the Faial Channel. We found the short-term home ranges of red porgy to be quite large for a reef fish - up to 50 ha. Further-more, frequent short-term displacements of up to 9 km and periodic absences from main core activity areas indicate that HR varies considerably in size and location throughout the year. Home range expansion occurred mostly during the protracted period of spawning activity, but we saw no evidence for spawning aggregations. We found evidence that individuals of smaller size utilize larger home ranges and are less site-specific, supporting the hypothesis that dispersal in the red porgy is largely determined by ontogenic changes. Large individual variability in both short-term and long-term movement patterns accounted for some emigrations from tagging sites and for one documented relocation. These findings indicate that adequate protection of subpopulations of red porgy will not be achieved using small, isolated reserves (1 to 5 km(2)), but reserves of size in the order of tens of km(2) and spaced a few kilometers apart should provide protection while promoting emigration (spillover) of red porgy from reserves to neighboring grounds. This study shows that the combination of spatial and temporal scales and approaches is needed to capture a realistic picture of the full suite of spatial behaviors used throughout a species' life history.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Guedes, Rui; Tempera, Fernando; Holland, Kim N.; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, IMAR DOP, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, IMAR DOP, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013; Tempera, Fernando/Q-1781-2018","Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589; Tempera, Fernando/0000-0001-9495-3731; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532",FCT/MCTES; Azorean DRCT; MAREFISH [FCT - POCTI/BSE/41207/2001]; MARMACII [IIIb-03/MAC/4.2/A2/2004],FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Azorean DRCT; MAREFISH; MARMACII,"We sincerely thank H.

Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support. On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well understood. Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community. Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an 'ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef. Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using network graph theory to analyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems.","[Fox, Rebecca J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; James Cook University,"Fox, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.fox@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011",,IMOS' Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS) Facility; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies,IMOS' Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS) Facility; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council),"We thank the staff of Orpheus Island Research Station for the provision of essential facilities; J.

Few studies have provided direct evidence of connectivity across seascapes, and the importance of benthic seascape structure on movement behavior is poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, we coupled hydro-acoustic technology to track fish with seafloor mapping and pattern analysis techniques from landscape ecology to quantify seascape structure. Bluestriped grunts Haemulon sciurus and schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus were tracked over 24 h periods using boat-based acoustic telemetry. Movement pathways, and day and night activity spaces were mapped using geographical information system (GIS) tools, and seafloor structure within activity spaces was mapped from high-resolution aerial photography and quantified using spatial pattern metrics. For both fish species, night activity spaces were significantly larger than day activity spaces. Fish exhibited a daytime preference for seascapes with aggregate coral reef and colonized bedrock, then shifted to night activity spaces with lower-complexity soft sediment including sand, seagrass, and scattered coral/rock. Movement path complexity was negatively correlated with seascape complexity. This demonstrates direct connectivity across multiple patch types and represents the first study to apply quantitative landscape ecology techniques to examine the movement ecology of marine fish. The spatially explicit approach facilitates understanding to the linkages between biological processes and the heterogeneity of the landscape. Such studies are essential for identifying ecologically relevant spatial scales, delineating essential fish habitat and designing marine protected areas.","[Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Biogeog Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Biogeog Branch, 1305 EW Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,,"Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",NOAA,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This research was supported by a NOAA cooperative agreement with the University of the Virgin Islands.

In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators, but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated. We used results of acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analyses to investigate the diel and seasonal movements of Galapagos sharks Carcharhinus galapagensis and giant trevally Caranx ignobilis captured from a mesophotic reef (depth: 50 to 70 m) at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. All predators associated with mesophotic reefs performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements, diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) and others performing reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the summer spawning periods. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to their variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra- specific competition. Mesophotic reefs may provide some prey to upper level predators but also serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients, particularly from shallow to mesophotic reefs.","[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Meyer, Carl G.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Kosaki, Randall K.] NOAA NOS Papahanaumokuakea Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Wallsgrove, Natalie J.; Popp, Brian N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Geol & Geophys, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of St Andrews; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Papastamatiou, YP (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Scottish Oceans Inst, St Andrews KY16 8LB, Fife, Scotland.",ypapastamatiou@gmail.com,,"Popp, Brian/0000-0001-7021-5478; Kosaki, Randall/0000-0003-1363-5702; Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",University of Florida Animal Care Protocol [201105813]; National Geographic Committee for Research Exploration [8951-11]; National Science Foundation [OCE-1041329]; Scottish Funding Council [HR09011]; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences [1040810] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,University of Florida Animal Care Protocol; National Geographic Committee for Research Exploration(National Geographic Society); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Scottish Funding Council; Directorate For Geosciences; Division Of Ocean Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO)),"We thank the crew of the NOAA research vessel 'Hi'ialakai' for supporting all field work in the NWHI.

Multiple shark species rely on coral reefs as important habitat and, as such, play a number of significant ecological roles in these ecosystems. How environmental stress impacts routine, site-attached reef shark behavior, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we combine 8 years of acoustic tracking data (2013-2020) from grey reef sharks resident to the remote coral reefs of the Chagos Archipelago in the Central Indian Ocean, with a satellite-based index of coral reef environmental stress exposure. We show that on average across the region, increased stress on the reefs significantly reduces grey reef shark residency, promoting more diffuse space use and increasing time away from shallow forereefs. Importantly, this impact has a lagged effect for up to 16 months. This may have important physiological and conservation consequences for reef sharks, as well as broader implications for reef ecosystem functioning. As climate change is predicted to increase environmental stress on coral reef ecosystems, understanding how site-attached predators respond to stress will be crucial for forecasting the functional significance of altering predator behavior and the potential impacts on conservation for both reef sharks and coral reefs themselves. Environmental stress on coral reefs is increasing. Authors show a stress-related reduction in residency of grey reef sharks on the remote reefs of the Chagos Archipelago, promoting more diffuse space use and increased time away from the shallow forereefs.","[Williamson, Michael J.; Curnick, David J.; Jacoby, David M.

However, little is known about juvenile stingray movement patterns and habitat use in coral reefs. This study used active acoustic telemetry to determine fine-scale diel movement patterns and habitat use of juvenile cowtail stingrays (Pastinachus ater) in a coral reef flat environment. Seven cowtail stingrays (4 males and 3 females) were manually tracked between April and December 2016. Each individual was tracked over 2 days, generating a total of 14 active tracks ranging from 4.91 to 9 h. Specimens moved at an average speed of 2.44 m min(-1) +/- 0.87 SE, with minimum distances travelled ranging from 546 to 1446 m. Tracking data showed that juvenile cowtail stingrays move in response to tidal cycles, moving faster and in straighter pathways during incoming and outgoing tides. Juvenile cowtail stingrays also showed a strong affinity to sand flat areas and mangrove edge areas. These areas provide food resources and potential refuges for juvenile rays to avoid predators. Coral reef flats were identified as secondary refuge for juveniles during the lowest tides. Future research is necessary to fully unveil the major drivers of juvenile cowtail stingray seasonal and ontogenetic movement patterns and habitat use within coral reef flat environments.

We used acoustic telemetry to investigate movement patterns between bay nursery habitats and adult reef habitats by a common Caribbean fish (Lutjanus apodus). We hypothesized that juvenile fish residing in their nurseries increase their home range as they grow and eventually include coral reefs in their activity range before their permanent migration to this adult habitat. Tagged fish were detected by underwater receivers for a period up to 12 months and a clear diel pattern was visible with most detections occurring during nighttime. Bay-to-reef movements were undertaken by fish that were larger than fish that were only detected in the bay. Stable isotope values of fin tissue from fish that showed reef-ward movements were similar to those of fish remaining in the bay, indicating that these movements were likely exploratory behavior as opposed to repeated feeding excursions. Understanding cross-habitat ontogenetic movements is essential for identification of ecologically relevant spatial scales for management of coastal fish populations.","[Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Huijbers, Chantal M.; Nagelkerken, Ivan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Layman, Craig A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, David Clark Labs 127, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; North Carolina State University,"Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",ivan.nagelkerken@adelaide.edu.au,"Huijbers, Chantal/J-5176-2014; Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011","Huijbers, Chantal/0000-0001-5206-3415; Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI; U.S. National Science Foundation [0746164],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was financially supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VIDI Grant to IN, as well as U.S. National Science Foundation Grant OCE #0746164 to CAL.

Despite a wide Indo-Pacific distribution, little is known about the spatial ecology of silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), compromising the ability to effectively manage their populations. We examined the residency and movements of silvertip sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 VR2W acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Twenty-seven individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored from 70 to 731 d. Residency index to the study site ranged from 0.05 to 0.97, with a mean residency (+/- SD) of 0.57 +/- 0.26, but most individuals were detected at or near their tagging reef. Clear seasonal patterns were apparent, with fewer individuals detected between September and February. A large proportion of the tagged population (> 71 %) moved regularly between reefs. Silvertip sharks were detected less during daytime and exhibited a strong diel pattern in depth use, which may be a strategy for optimizing energetic budgets and foraging opportunities. This study provides the first detailed examination of the spatial ecology and behavior of silvertip sharks on coral reefs. Silvertip sharks remained resident at coral reef habitats over long periods, but our results also suggest this species may have more complex movement patterns and use larger areas of the GBR than common reef shark species. Our findings highlight the need to further understand the movement ecology of silvertip sharks at different spatial and temporal scales, which is critical for developing effective management approaches.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

Concurrently, herbivorous fishes have been severely overfished in many locations worldwide, contributing to increases in macroalgal cover. We used a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary approach to test if higher biomass of herbivorous fishes inside a no-take marine reserve makes this area more resistant to invasive algal overgrowth. Over a two year time period, we (1) compared fish biomass and algal cover between two fished and one unfished patch reef in Hawai'i, (2) used acoustic telemetry to determine fidelity of herbivorous fishes to the unfished reef, and (3) used metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing to determine diet composition of herbivorous fishes. Herbivore fish biomass was significantly higher in the marine reserve compared to adjacent fished reefs, whereas invasive algal cover differed by species. Herbivorous fish movements were largely confined to the unfished patch reef where they were captured. Diet analysis indicated that the consumption of invasive algae varied among fish species, with a high prevalence of comparatively rare native algal species. Together these findings demonstrate that the contribution of herbivores to coral reef resilience, via resistance to invasive algae invasion, is complex and species-specific.","[Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.; Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC USA; [Meyer, Carl G.; Fernandez-Silva, Iria; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Fernandez-Silva, Iria] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA",Curtin University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Geographic Society; University of Hawaii System; California Academy of Sciences,"Stamoulis, KA (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia.;Stamoulis, KA (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kostanti@hawaii.edu,"Fernandez-Silva, Iria/AAA-8996-2020; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019","Stamoulis, Kostantinos/0000-0003-2688-4695","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Overseas Researchers and two Marie Curie Actions of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under REA grant [302957, 600391]; Sea Grant award [NA09OAR4170197]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA09OAR4170197]",Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Overseas Researchers and two Marie Curie Actions of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under REA grant(Marie Curie Actions); Sea Grant award; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors would like to thank Cindy Hunter of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa for logistical support and the use of the UH Marine Biology program boat, Jason Jones of the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology for diving support and tank fills, Brian Neilson and his team of the Hawai'i State Division of Aquatic Resources for providing information and fieldwork assistance, and Stacy Bierwagen of James Cook University for her work on fecal dispersal.

Therefore, understanding how the behaviour and spatial ecology of a species differs across reef habitats is essential for developing sound conservation approaches. The present study examined the residency, movement and activity space of grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers covering 17 semi-isolated coral reefs across 150 km was used to monitor shark movements. Forty C. amblyrhynchos were tagged with acoustic transmitters and monitored from 251 to 821 days. Most sharks were detected on a single reef; however, some individuals (4 females; 10 males) moved to up to five reefs. Residency index ranged from 0.02 to 1.0, with a mean +/- A SD of 0.78 +/- A 0.26. Mixed-effect models showed that weekly and monthly residency was mainly influenced by shark size, with little or no effect of environmental parameters. Although C. amblyrhynchos were present year-round, juvenile sharks had lower residency to their tagging reef than adults. In addition, mature females were detected less between November and mid-February, which coincides with reported parturition in the central GBR. Long-term monitoring data revealed that C. amblyrhynchos exhibited high residency to their tagging reef, and therefore, even in systems with semi-isolated reefs such as the GBR, this species may benefit from spatial management approaches at the reef level. However, behavioural differences between sexes and life-stages of C. amblyrhynchos reported in this study suggest marine reserves may provide lower protection relative to more remote and isolated coral reefs.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency (>0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",marioespinozamen@gmail.com,"Espinoza, Mario/AAV-3460-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Australian Government [6.1]; Australian Research Council [FT100101004]; PADI Foundation; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences; Australian Endeavour; AIMS@JCU Scholarships; Australian Research Council [FT100101004] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,"Australian Government(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); PADI Foundation; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences; Australian Endeavour(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); AIMS@JCU Scholarships; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This project was funded by the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub Project 6.1).

However, information on the movement behavior of individual fish, over fine temporal and spatial scales, continues to be limited. While conducting a larger project in the northern Florida Keys in 2002, we surgically-tagged a small number of Scarus coeruleus Bloch 1786 and S. taeniopterus Desmarest in Bory de Saint-Vincent 1831 with acoustic transmitters inside the Conch Reef Research Only Area (a no-take marine reserve). Our objective was to characterize the movement of both species across Conch Reef, and to quantify any fish fidelity to the site where they were caught and released. All fish were captured, surgically-tagged, and released in situ during a saturation mission to the Aquarius Undersea Laboratory. Movement of tagged fishes was recorded in 5 receiving zones formed by the overlapping ranges of 3 acoustic receivers deployed on the seafloor. Results show limited movement of both species occurred across Conch Reef. Recorded site fidelity was higher among tagged S. taeniopterus than among S. coeruleus and varied considerably among individuals. While the number of fish departures from the receiving zones was varied, the majority of departures for each species were less than 30 min in duration for both species, suggesting that when departures occurred, the fish did not travel far. Future efforts will significantly expand the number of receivers at Conch Reef such that both movement and site fidelity can be quantified with increased temporal and spatial resolution.","Stellwagen Bank Natl Marine Sanctuary, Scituate, MA 02066 USA; Boston Univ, Marine Program, Boston, MA 02215 USA; Univ N Carolina, Natl Undersea Res Ctr, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Boston University; University of North Carolina,"Lindholm, J (corresponding author), Pfleger Inst Environm Res, 901-B Pier View Way, Oceanside, CA 92054 USA.",james@pier.org,,,,,,,15,14,17,0,18,UNIV PUERTO RICO,MAYAGUEZ,"COLLEGE ARTS SCIENCES, MAYAGUEZ, PR 00680 USA",0008-6452,,,CARIBB J SCI,Caribb.

Among MPAs, a large percentage has been created with the implicit goal of protecting shark populations, including 17 shark sanctuaries which fully protect sharks throughout their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas represents a long-term MPA for sharks, following the banning of commercial longlining in 1993 and subsequent designation as a shark sanctuary in 2011. Little is known, however, about the longterm behavior and space use of sharks within this protected area, particularly among reef-associated sharks for which the sanctuary presumably offers the most benefit. We used acoustic telemetry to advance our understanding of the ecology of such sharks, namely Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), over two discrete islands (New Providence and Great Exuma) varying in human activity level, over 2 years. We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space. Tiger sharks were associated with shallow seagrass habitats where available, but frequently transited between and connected different habitat types. Our data support the notion that large MPAs afford greater degrees of protection for highly resident species such as Caribbean reef sharks, shark, acoustic telemetry, marine protected area, MPA, seagrass, coral reef, Bahamas, Caribbean","[Gallagher, Austin J.; Shipley, Oliver N.; Kattan, Sami; Shea, Brendan D.] Waves, Herndon, VA 20172 USA; [Shipley, Oliver N.; Frisk, Michael G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Bergmann, Maurits P.

The spatial and temporal movements of 19 sea bream (Archosargus rhomboidalis), an ecologically important species in mangrove estuaries of the western Atlantic, were investigated in multiple bays on a Caribbean Island over two years using surgically implanted acoustic transmitters. Fish were almost continuously monitored (residency index 96-100%) by an array of hydrophones during the 11-13 month battery-life of their transmitters. Individual fish utilized small core areas (mean = 9.8 ha during daytime and 11.0 ha at night), displayed daily site fidelity (mean = 57% overlap in day night core area), showed no evidence of an ontogenetic increase in core habitat size, and many exhibited a change in the bays utilized during winter months which is coincident with suspected spawning. Fish captured from the same bay generally occupied the same spaces within the study area, and in similar proportions, compared to fish captured in adjacent bays. Fish from different bays did not mix and wander throughout the ecosystem even though it is all suitable habitat and is used by different groups of localized individuals. This similarity of occupancy patterns is limited to the spatial scale of bays and temporal scales of weeks or months. When considered at the resolution of individual receivers and hourly time steps, most fish are not in close proximity to one another for the vast majority of the time. Although some pairs of fish had as many as 84% of their hourly detections on the same receivers in the month after tagging, they gradually spent less time near each other, even though their overall pattern of movements was consistent at the scale of whole bays. This highlights the importance of examining movements of fish on multiple spatial scales and time-intervals to understand their interactions.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Monaco, Mark E.; Winship, Arliss J.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, MSE,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss J.] CSS Inc, 10301 Democracy LaneSuite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ruffo, Ashley] ERT Inc, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 3013 Estate Golden Rock, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA; [Holloway, Nathaniel Hanna] Natl Pk Serv, 2100 Church St 100, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

Temporal partitioning of resources can reduce intra-specific competition, but this has seldom been examined in predators in marine ecosystems. Here, we used 8 years of acoustic telemetry data from 27 receivers deployed in a large coastal embayment to examine the temporal residency of 51 Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), during their breeding season. We found that the residency lengths of male and female Port Jackson sharks on breeding reefs differed throughout the breeding season, with males showing longer residency at the start of the season and females showing longer residency at the end of the season. Port Jackson sharks also showed a 24-h or diel periodicity in their detection patterns. Although the majority of individuals were nocturnal, a small proportion of sharks was detected more frequently during the day, possibly to reduce competition for resources. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the sex ratio nor the size of diurnal and nocturnal individuals. This study provides long-term insight into the temporal residency patterns of mesopredatory sharks at a breeding site and, more broadly, our results highlight the importance of studying temporal variation at the individual level in movement ecology studies.","[Bass, Nathan Charles; Day, Joanna; Brown, Culum] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Day, Joanna] Taronga Conservat Soc Australia, Taronga Inst Sci & Learning, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia; [Guttridge, Tristan L.] Saving Blue, Cooper City, FL 33328 USA; [Knott, Nathan A.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, 4 Woollamia Rd, Huskisson, NSW 2540, Australia",Macquarie University; Taronga Conservation Society Australia; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Bass, NC (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",nathancbass@mail.com,"Knott, Nathan/AAA-8888-2019; Brown, Culum/S-9826-2017","Brown, Culum/0000-0002-0210-1820; Bass, Nathan/0000-0002-5815-1392; Knott, Nathan/0000-0002-7873-0412",,,,,71,9,10,0,7,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

We observed 4 species of reef sharks aggregating in an inshore bay in the north of Western Australia for over 2 yr, using acoustic telemetry and visual censuses to examine how they partitioned this site in space and time. We fitted 58 sharks with acoustic transmitters: Carcharhinus melanopterus (36), C. amblyrhynchos (11), Negaprion acutidens (7) and Triaenodon obesus (4). Aggregations consisted primarily of C. melanopterus, although C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens were often present. We observed aggregations by visual census in summer (maximum of 44 sharks). Detections were highest during warmer months (Sep to Mar) for all species, although some individuals showed year-round residency. C. melanopterus, C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens had strong diel patterns of attendance at the aggregation site. Peak daily detections occurred from 13: 00 to 14: 00 h local time for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos; juvenile C. melanopterus and N. acutidens peaked at 05:00 and 10:00 h, respectively. There was considerable spatial overlap of core areas of use (50% kernel density estimates) at the northern end of the bay by all species; the southern end was used primarily by C. melanopterus and N. acutidens. Aggregations of C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos consisted mainly of adult females, some of them pregnant. Courtship behaviour in C. melanopterus and T. obesus suggests that these aggregations are related to reproduction. All species displayed inter-annual site fidelity. The long-term presence of juvenile C. melanopterus and N. acutidens also suggests that this bay provides suitable conditions for younger age classes.","[Speed, Conrad W.; Meekan, Mark G.; Berger, Yuval] Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Oceans Inst M096, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Speed, Conrad W.; Field, Iain C.; McMahon, Clive R.] Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Environm Res, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Field, Iain C.] Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Environm, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Stevens, John D.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [McGregor, Frazer] Murdoch Univ, Field Stn, Coral Bay, WA 6701, Australia; [Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Huveneers, Charlie; Bradshaw, Corey J.

Residencies to both sites were low for pleuronectiform fishes (C. sordidus, P. verticalis, P. vetulus, less than 10% of the study duration was spent in either site), which indicates that tissue samples from these species likely reflect the accumulation of contaminants across individuals' ranges, not just the outfall site.

Long-term acoustic monitoring was used to ascertain site fidelity and seasonal movement patterns of S, pulcher. We implanted 16 adult (24 to 36 cm standard length) fish with long-term (similar to 1 yr) acoustic transmitters and their presence and movement patterns were monitored in the Catalina Marine Science Center Marine Life Reserve using an acoustic receiver array. A method was developed that explained some of the variability in detection frequencies. A negative relationship between detection frequency and activity (rate of movement) was found for S. pulcher moving within the array. Most fish exhibited high site fidelity to the general area of the reserve, with 13 of the 16 fish detected spending an average of 99 +/- 2% of their total days at liberty in the study area, with a mean of 90 +/- 9% of total residence time spent within a 600 m core area. However, these fish showed some variability in area use between months, exhibiting periods of expansion in their range. Fish also tended to increase activity as seasonal water temperature increased. These expanded movements resulted in some fish crossing the reserve boundary for extended periods or leaving the reserve permanently.","Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Topping, DT (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",dtopping13@hotmail.com,,,,,,,42,66,87,0,34,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Acoustic telemetry is arguably the most popular method used to study the movements of fish. Despite this method being able to elucidate many aspects of movement behavior, including residency, home range, and migration, among others, one aspect that remains challenging is the study and definition of connectivity, particularly within marine seascapes. As such, this review assesses published literature on acoustic telemetry studies, which have specifically assessed some aspect of fish connectivity, and discusses these in terms of study distribution and overall trends, the diversity of taxa and life stage assessed, the role that large-scale acoustic telemetry networks plays in assessing connectivity of marine fishes, how connectivity studies have been used in an applied context, and proposes definitions linked to specific types of connectivity, which will assist future researchers when conceptualizing studies. Further, methods that can be used in conjunction with acoustic telemetry to complement the data are discussed. Given that marine resources and habitats are intricately connected, this review highlights the critical role that acoustic telemetry can play in assessing this link. It is envisaged that our developed framework of connectivity definitions will assist future studies and stakeholders in assessing ecosystem functioning and ultimately contribute to improved conservation and management of marine fish populations and ecosystems.","[Welch, Rebecca J.; Childs, Amber-Robyn; Murray, Taryn S.; James, Nicola C.] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Private Bag 1015, Makhanda 6140, South Africa; [Childs, Amber-Robyn; Murray, Taryn S.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, Makhanda, South Africa; [Darnaude, Audrey M.] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier, France; [James, Nicola C.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Gqeberha, South Africa",National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; Rhodes University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ifremer; Universite de Montpellier; Nelson Mandela University,"Welch, RJ (corresponding author), South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Private Bag 1015, Makhanda 6140, South Africa.",welchrebecca83@gmail.com,"James, Nicola/HTP-6378-2023; Darnaude, Audrey/D-1745-2014; Murray, Taryn/M-4252-2017","Murray, Taryn/0000-0003-2694-7588; James, Nicola/0000-0002-9472-5314; Childs, Amber-Robyn/0000-0003-4717-2646",South African National Research Foundation [221]; COST Action; COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology),South African National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This article is based on the work from COST Action CA19107/Ocean Decade Action 221 Unifying Approaches to Marine Connectivity for Improved Resource Management for the Seas (SEA-UNICORN), supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology, ).",,140,1,1,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Hawksbill turtles Eretmo-chelys imbricata are considered a key species in coral reef-associated communities, owing to their specific foraging preferences, yet new information is still revealing details of the spatial and temporal aspects of habitat use. We used passive acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of 18 juvenile hawksbills (minimum curved carapace length: 32.0-59.7 cm, mean +/- SD = 43.9 +/- 6.7 cm) at a developmental foraging site in a Mesoamerican barrier reef, Lighthouse Reef Atoll in Belize (tracking duration 10-1414 d, mean +/- SD = 570 +/- 484 d). Although specific home ranges were difficult to quantify, several turtles showed high site fidelity over timescales of months to years, with occasional wide-ranging use of the atoll. Diel variation in the number of detections received strongly suggest nocturnal resting. Long-term tracking data reveal 3 degrees of site fidelity across the atoll, based on the number of detection days near individual stations: high residency(n = 4 turtles), equential residency (n = 5), and transient behavior (n = 4). These variations in movement raise questions about the differentiation of foraging habitats and degree of individual specialization within this population, as well as the influences of microhabitats and human disturbance.","[Chevis, Megan G.; Godley, Brendan J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England; [Chevis, Megan G.; Lewis, Julie Jackson; Graham, Rachel T.] MarAlliance, 32 Coconut Dr,POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize; [Lewis, James P.] Amphibian Survival Alliance, Int Conservat House,7078 Airlie Rd, Warrenton, VA 20187 USA; [Scales, Kylie L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Scales, Kylie L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Ctr, Environm Res Div, 99 Pacific St,Suite 255A, Monterey, CA 93950 USA",University of Exeter; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Graham, RT (corresponding author), MarAlliance, 32 Coconut Dr,POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize.",rachel@maralliance.org,"godley, brendan/A-6139-2009; Scales, Kylie/L-9318-2018","godley, brendan/0000-0003-3845-0034; Chevis, Megan/0000-0002-5996-693X; Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956",MarAlliance; Summit Foundation; British Chelonia Group; Wildlife Conservation Society; Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation,MarAlliance; Summit Foundation; British Chelonia Group; Wildlife Conservation Society; Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation,"Support was provided by MarAlliance, The Summit Foundation, British Chelonia Group, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation.

However, many knowledge gaps about their biology and ecology hinder conservation efforts. Here we used a combination of acoustic telemetry and acceleration datalogger technology to gain fundamental insights into the fine-scale behaviour, habitat use, size of activity spaces, and residency of adult female bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae) in the Ningaloo region of northwestern Australia. Acoustic tracking data over one year demonstrated that female bottlenose wedgefish continuously resided in a relatively small area of a productive coral reef lagoon. Acceleration data revealed that bottlenose wedgefish were nocturnal, with time of day having a greater influence on activity than tidal patterns. Bottlenose wedgefish also increased activity with seasonally increasing temperatures. We identified several discrete behavioural signatures in the acceleration data, inferred to correspond to chafing, settling/burying behaviour, foraging behaviour, and escape behaviour, based on their kinematics. Further observations are required to confirm these behaviours with certainty. Additionally, according to datalogger and acoustic data, tagged bottlenose wedgefish rarely inhabited areas greater than 2 m deep. Together, these first insights into behaviour and habitat use of adult female bottlenose wedgefish highlight the importance of nearshore habitats for this species and indicate that they may be highly resident to specific areas. Our findings provide important insight into the conservation of bottlenose wedgefish in northwestern Australia, including potential effectiveness of protected areas and interactions with specific anthropogenic threats such as shoreline development and recreational beach fishing.","[Lear, Karissa O.; Morgan, David L.; Gleiss, Adrian C.; Bateman, Rebecca L.] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Estrabeau, Carlos; Bateman, Rebecca L.] Fin Focus Res, Exmouth, WA, Australia; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Newport Aquarium, Newport, KY 41071 USA; [Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Environm & Conservat Sci, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Bignell, Colby] Environm Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Bignell, Colby] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Pillans, Richard D.] Environm Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia",Murdoch University; Murdoch University; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lear, KO (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",k.lear@murdoch.edu.au,"Pillans, Richard/F-2458-2012; Morgan, David/H-9794-2019; Gleiss, Adrian/E-5960-2011","Bignell, Colby James/0000-0003-4732-8655; Bateman, Rebecca/0000-0003-3282-1973; Morgan, David/0000-0003-1948-1484; Gleiss, Adrian/0000-0002-9960-2858; Lear, Karissa/0000-0002-2648-8564",CAUL; Murdoch University; Oceania Chondrichthyan Society; Minderoo Exmouth Field Laboratory; Artemis Films; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; Integrated Marine Observing System,CAUL; Murdoch University; Oceania Chondrichthyan Society; Minderoo Exmouth Field Laboratory; Artemis Films; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Integrated Marine Observing System,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

We tagged 39 sharks (mostly adult females) of which 31 were detected regularly throughout the study. Sharks displayed strong inter-annual residency with greater attendance at monitored sites during summer than winter months. More individuals were detected during the day than at night. Mean depths of tagged sharks increased from 35 m in winter to 60 m in spring following an increase in water temperature at 60 m, with maximum mean depths attained when water temperatures at 60 m stabilised around 29 degrees C. Sharks descended to greater depths and used a wider range of depths around the time of the full moon. There were also crepuscular cycles in mean depth, with sharks moving into shallower waters at dawn and dusk each day. We suggest that daily, lunar and seasonal cycles in vertical movement and residency are strategies for optimising both energetic budgets and foraging behaviour. Cyclical patterns of movement in response to environmental variables might affect the susceptibility of reef sharks to fishing, a consideration that should be taken into account in the implementation of conservation strategies.","[Vianna, Gabriel M.

Because of the predictability of annual aggregations, giant sea bass (GSB) were fished throughout the twentieth century until they were nearly extirpated from southern California and Baja California, Mexico. To assess population recovery, acoustic telemetry was used to quantify spatiotemporal rhythmicity of GSB aggregations at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. Thirty-two individuals were tracked for 498 days over two consecutive spawning seasons in 2017-2018 and visual surveys were conducted monthly to estimate aggregation sizes. Aggregation behavior was documented from June-October and spawning most likely occurred at a pinnacle promontory from July-September. GSB exhibited residency to specific sites throughout the year and individuals showed fidelity to suspected spawning aggregation sites during the summer months. Ten (31%) GSB were detected at Santa Catalina Island year-round and 11 (34%) exhibited suspected annual spawning site fidelity. Four individuals (12%) were documented leaving the island during late fall/winter 2017 and returning in spring/early summer 2018, indicating partial seasonal migration and year-round fidelity to specific sites at Santa Catalina Island.

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to infer movement patterns of seven adult C. latus within Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a no-take marine protected area (MPA) northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, a preliminary exploration of detections recorded outside of BIRNM was used to gain knowledge of the potential for larger scale movements. Ascertaining long-term movement patterns, including residency, mobility, and identifying core activity spaces can play a considerable role in how MPAs, like BIRNM, are adapted to meet the needs of mobile species.ResultsHigh residency index values were observed for individual C. latus within the BIRNM array (meanSE: 0.913 +/- 0.04, range 0.75-1.0) across the 17 months monitored. Most fish were also detected on receivers located outside BIRNM. An observed to expected detection ratio revealed that despite high residency, only 9.6% of expected transmissions were detected based on the average tag transmission rate. Network analysis revealed high individual connectivity with many of the receivers inside BIRNM and a large number of core use receivers (mean: 10.7, range 6-14) within individual networks.ConclusionsMost C. latus were present in BIRNM at least twice per day, but were overall detected below the expected rates, demonstrating mobility, large core activity spaces and wide use of the acoustic array inside BIRNM and greater St. Croix shelf. How residency is inferred from acoustic telemetry detections, and interpreted for species with variable mobility, has important considerations for spatial management planning and telemetry analyses. For MPA development to meet the spatial requirements of species with mixed resident-mobile spatial ecology, detailed long-term movement data are required.

The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea, first documented in the Caribbean in 2002, has rapidly expanded its range, displacing native seagrasses, and overgrowing bare sand. The southern stingray (Hypanus americanus) uses shallow seagrass and sand habitats for foraging. This paper examined the impacts of the invasive seagrass, H. stipulacea, on southern stingray behavior, foraging and movement patterns using acoustic telemetry and visual observations. From 2015 to 2018, 15 southern stingrays (14 juveniles of unknown sex and 1 female) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored within an acoustic array in Brewers and Perseverance Bays, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. The residence time, rates of movement and activity spaces for 50% and 95% utilization distributions (UD) were calculated for day and night periods. Tagged southern stingrays were detected within the array on average for 260 d (range 11-801 d) and residency for all individuals averaged 53% over the monitoring period (1079 d). Mean rates of movement per individual ranged from 40 to 150 m h(-1), was lowest during the nighttime and were significantly higher during crepuscular periods. Activity spaces during day and night periods were nearly identical and averaged 0.05 km(2) and 0.25 km(2) for 50% and 95% UD, respectively. Distances between day and night 50% UD activity spaces was 148 m (range 8-409 m) and mean percent overlap was 38%. In addition to acoustic monitoring, benthic cover of available habitats and visual surveys of stingray behavior and habitat preferences were conducted along fixed transects. Monotypic stands of the invasive H. stipulacea seagrass represented 42% of benthic cover, followed by bare sand (27%), mixed patches of native and invasive seagrasses (23%) and the native Syringodium filiforme (7%). A habitat selection index (HSI) comparing the percent cover of available habitats and habitats occupied by stingrays found a strong preference for the native seagrass S. filiforme (HSI = 2.30) and bare sand (HSI = 1.79) compared to H. stipulacea (HSI = 0.70). Visual surveys also revealed that 50% of foraging stingrays were in S. filiforme, while 28% and 17% were foraging in H. stipulacea and bare sand, respectively. Our results are an important baseline for examining how further expansion of H. stipulacea may affect southern stingray movement patterns and foraging preferences.","[Legernes, Michele] Bellona Environm Fdn, Radhusgata 28, N-0513 Oslo, Norway; [Legernes, Michele] Marea, Ormsundveien 16, N-0198 Oslo, Norway; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers, US Virgin Isl, MD 00803 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Ctr Coastal Studies, Shark Ecol Program, 5 Holway Ave, Provincetown, MA 02657 USA",University of the Virgin Islands,"Nemeth, RS (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers, US Virgin Isl, MD 00803 USA.",ricknemeth.usvi@gmail.com,,"Legare, Bryan/0000-0001-6791-0293",Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) (NSF) [1355437],Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) (NSF),"Funding provided by Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) Grant (NSF #1355437) .

This is particularly relevant for defining what factors are driving the presence, location, and movements of individuals. The long-term movement and space use patterns of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, were examined on a whole of reef scale in the southern Great Barrier Reef to define whether movement and activity space varied through time. Twenty-nine C. amblyrhynchos were tracked for over 2 years to define movement patterns. All individuals showed high residency within the study site, but also had high roaming indices. This indicated that individuals remained in the region and used all of the monitored habitat (i.e., the entire reef perimeter). Use of space was consistent through time with high reuse of areas most of the year. Therefore, individuals maintained discrete home ranges, but undertook broader movements around the reef at times. Mature males showed greatest variation in movement with larger activity spaces and movement into new regions during the mating season (August-September). Depth use patterns also differed, suggesting behaviour or resource requirements varied between sexes. Examination of the long-term, reef-scale movements of C. amblyrhynchos has revealed that reproductive activity may play a key role in space use and activity patterns. It was unclear whether mating behaviour or an increased need for food to sustain reproductive activity and development played a greater role in these patterns. Reef shark movement patterns are becoming more clearly defined, but research is still required to fully understand the biological drivers for the observed patterns.","[Heupel, M.

However, the importance of these habitats in sustaining marine species at seascape scales is debated, and their significance to reef shark populations is poorly understood. The blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus is a widely distributed mobile marine predator; we explored its use of shallow, turbid coastal habitats in the Great Barrier Reef using tagging and acoustic telemetry. Residency and movement patterns of 23 individuals were monitored for up to 28 mo, revealing different patterns between sexes and sizes. Neonate/juveniles were short-term residents; adult females were long-term residents and preliminary data suggest that adult males were vagrants. Adult females and neonate/juveniles had small activity spaces (50% kernel utilisation distribution, KUD < 5 km(2)) and shared the same habitats and locations while adult males (when present) had larger activity spaces (50% KUD up to 14 km(2)). Population organisation, movement patterns and biological data suggest that blacktip reef sharks may use turbid coastal habitats for reproduction. This study reveals a new variation in coastal habitat use by sharks with habitat use patterns differing from those observed in other coastal sharks, and from conspecifics on coral reefs. These patterns do not conform to the characteristics of classical shark nurseries, and highlight the species' ecological flexibility. The study also demonstrates that shark behaviour and habitat use patterns can affect their vulnerability to fishing, habitat loss and climate change, and can affect the efficacy of marine protected areas.","[Chin, Andrew; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Tobin, Andrew J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville Mail Ctr, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Chin, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",andrew.chin@jcu.edu.au,"Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Chin, Andrew/C-2254-2008","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332; Chin, Andrew/0000-0003-1813-4042",Australian Government through the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility Project 4.8.4; James Cook University; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; Australian Research Council,Australian Government through the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility Project 4.8.4(Australian Government); James Cook University; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank funding agencies and collaborators, principally the Australian Government through the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility Project 4.8.4 and also James Cook University and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

The use of acoustic monitoring and network analysis can improve our understanding of the spatial ecology and functional connectivity of reef-associated species, providing a useful approach for reef-based conservation planning. This study compared and contrasted the movement and connectivity of sharks with different degrees of reef association. We examined the residency, dispersal, degree of reef connectivity, and MPA use of grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), silvertip (C. albimarginatus), and bull (C. leucas) sharks monitored in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus were detected most days at or near their tagging reef. However, while C. amblyrhynchos spent 80% of monitoring days in the array, C. albimarginatus was only detected 50% of the time. Despite both species moving similar distances (<50 km), a large portion of the population of C. albimarginatus (71%) was detected on multiple reefs and moved more frequently between reefs and management zones than C. amblyrhynchos. Carcharhinus leucas was detected less than 20% of the time within the tagging array, and 42% of the population undertook long-range migrations to other arrays in the GBR. Networks derived for C. leucas were larger and more complex than those for C. amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus. Our findings suggest that protecting specific reefs based on prior knowledge (e.g., healthier reefs with high fish biomass) and increasing the level of protection to include nearby, closely spaced reef habitats (<20 km) may perform better for species like C. albimarginatus than having either a single or a network of isolated MPAs. This design would also provide protection for larger male C. amblyrhynchos, which tend to disperse more and use larger areas than females. For wide-ranging sharks like C. leucas, a combination of spatial planning and other alternative measures is critical. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic monitoring can serve as a useful platform for designing more effective MPA networks for reef predators displaying a range of movement patterns.","[Espinoza, Mario; Ledee, Elodie J.

Shelf-wide migrations of this stock are well documented, but movements and home ranges of fish during their inshore residency period have not been described. We tagged 122 Black Sea Bass with acoustic transmitters at a mid-Atlantic reef to estimate home-range size and factors that influence movements (>400 m) at a 46.1-km(2) study site between May and November 2003. Activity of Black Sea Bass was greatest and most consistent during summer but declined rapidly in September as water temperatures at the bottom of the seafloor increased on the inner shelf. Black Sea Bass maintained relatively large home ranges that were fish-size invariant but highly variable (13.7-736.4 ha), underscoring the importance of large sample sizes in examination of population-level characteristics of mobile species with complex social interactions. On the basis of observed variations in movement patterns and the size of home ranges, we postulate the existence of groups of conspecifics that exhibit similar space-use behaviors. The group of males released earlier in the tagging period used larger home ranges than the group of males released later in our study. In addition, mean activity levels and the probability of movement among acoustic stations varied among groups of fish in a complex manner that depended on sex. These differences in movement behaviors may increase the vulnerability of male fish to passive fishing gears, further exacerbating variation in exploitation rates for this species among reefs.","[Fabrizio, Mary C.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Manderson, John P.; Pessutti, Jeffrey P.] NOAA, James J Howard Marine Sci Lab, Noertheast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Highlands, NJ 07732 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Fabrizio, MC (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",mfabrizio@vims.edu,,"Fabrizio, Mary/0000-0002-6115-5490",U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Moses D.

However, site attachment in many reef residents, such as reef sharks, could mean that relocation in response to unfavourable environmental conditions may not be feasible. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to monitor movement and space use of 18 blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus on an inshore reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia, to determine their response to environmental change. Activity space of sharks was modelled against combinations of environmental (wind speed, rain, salinity and water temperature) and biological (size, sex) factors. Size was the most influential predictor of space use, with larger sharks having larger activity spaces. Sex also appeared in top-performing models, showing that juvenile males use more space than juvenile females, although effects were marginal. Model results also indicated a relationship between shark activity space and salinity, where space use increased with decreasing salinity. A similar but weaker relationship was observed with water temperature. These results show that blacktip reef sharks respond to minor changes in salinity, suggesting that they may be able to relocate when conditions are unfavourable, and help define the resilience of this species to disturbance and change.","[Schlaff, Audrey M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Udyawer, Vinay; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Schlaff, Audrey M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Udyawer, Vinay; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.; Udyawer, Vinay] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Schlaff, AM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Schlaff, AM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",audrey.schlaff@my.jcu.edu.au,"Udyawer, Vinay/L-9432-2019; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332; Schlaff, Audrey/0000-0002-2650-5969; Udyawer, Vinay/0000-0001-5812-0740; Simpfendorfer, Colin/0000-0002-0295-2238","Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority [G10/33754.1, G10/33240.1]; JCU's Animal Ethics Committee [A1566]",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program(Australian Government); Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; JCU's Animal Ethics Committee,"We thank staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group at James Cook University (JCU) who helped with field efforts, including F. de Faria, S.
