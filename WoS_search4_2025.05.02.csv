However, there remains much debate about how effective MPAs are, especially in terms of their ability to protect mobile marine species such as teleost and chondrichthyan fishes. We used satellite and acoustic tags to assess the ability of a large oceanic MPA, the British Indian Ocean Territory MPA (BIOT MPA), to protect seven species of pelagic and reef-associated teleost and chondrichthyan fishes. We satellite-tagged 26 animals from six species (Blue Marlin, Reef Mantas, Sailfish, Silky Sharks, Silvertip Sharks, and Yellowfin Tuna), producing 2,735 days of movement data. We also acoustically tagged 121 sharks from two species (Grey Reef and Silvertip Sharks), which were monitored for up to 40 months across a large acoustic receiver array spanning the MPA. We found that the activity spaces of all satellite-tagged animals, including pelagic species, were much smaller than the area of the BIOT MPA, even taking into account errors associated with position estimates. Estimates of space use of acoustically tagged sharks, based on dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMM), were also much smaller than the size of the MPA. However, we found important limitations when using dBBMM and demonstrate its sensitivity to both study duration and array design. We found that Grey Reef Sharks should be monitored for at least 1 year and Silvertip Sharks for 2 years before their activity space can be effectively estimated. We also demonstrate the potentially important role that intraspecific variability in spatial ecology may play in influencing the ability of MPAs to effectively protect populations of mobile species. Overall, our results suggest that, with effective enforcement, MPAs on the scale of the BIOT MPA potentially offer protection to a variety of pelagic and reef species with a range of spatial ecologies. We suggest that animals need to be tagged across seasons, years, and ontogenetic stages, in order to fully characterize their spatial ecology, which is fundamental to developing and implementing effective MPAs to conserve the full life history of target species.","[Carlisle, Aaron B.; Dale, Jonathan J.; Ferretti, Francesco; Chapple, Taylor K.; Schallert, Robert J.; Castleton, Michael; Block, Barbara A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Tickler, David] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Futures Lab, Perth, WA, Australia; [Curnick, David J.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Curnick, David J.] UCL, Dept Genet Evolut & Environm, Ctr Biodivers & Environm Res, London, England; [Carlisle, Aaron B.] Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA",Stanford University; University of Western Australia; Zoological Society of London; University of London; University College London; University of Delaware,"Carlisle, AB (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA.;Carlisle, AB (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Sch Marine Sci & Policy, Lewes, DE 19958 USA.",carlisle@udel.edu,"Ferretti, Francesco/AAR-2545-2020; Tickler, David/KIC-7386-2024","Schallert, Robert/0000-0002-3584-2668; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0001-9510-3552; Carlisle, Aaron/0000-0003-0796-6564; Curnick, David/0000-0002-3093-1282",Bertarelli Foundation,Bertarelli Foundation,Funding for this project was provided by the Bertarelli Foundation and contributed to the Bertarelli Programme in Marine Science.,,68,50,51,2,32,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.","[Scott, Molly E.; Pratchett, Morgan S.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Matley, Jordan K.] Univ Windsor, Great Lakes Inst Environm Res, Windsor, ON, Canada",James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; University of Windsor,"Scott, ME (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",molly.scott@my.jcu.edu.au,"Pratchett, Morgan/AAW-5179-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Pratchett, Morgan/A-9256-2010","Simpfendorfer, Colin/0000-0002-0295-2238; Pratchett, Morgan/0000-0002-1862-8459; Matley, Jordan/0000-0003-4286-597X; Scott, Molly/0000-0002-5738-221X; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation,Fisheries Research and Development Corporation,"Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Grant/Award Number: FRDCDCCEE",,74,13,13,1,29,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

Five goatfish equipped with acoustic transmitters were tracked for up to 93 h each over 3-14 days. Daytime habitat use patterns of two of these fish were continuously monitored for one month using a fixed hydrophone hardwired to an onshore computer. Acoustically tagged fish showed consistent diel patterns of behavior, refuging in holes in the reef by day and moving over extensive areas of sand and coral rubble habitat at night. Remote monitoring of daytime habitat use by two goatfish revealed that the same daytime refuge was used by both fish for at least one month (the battery life of the transmitters). Home ranges of all fish were within the boundaries of the Coconut Island reserve suggesting that even small areas containing suitable habitat can make effective reserves for this species. A relatively low abundance of reproductive size P. porphyreus at Coconut Island in comparison with deeper areas may indicate an ontogenetic shift to deeper habitat in this species.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NESC, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021",,,,,,26,130,154,0,47,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0378-1909,,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

However, most studies have focused on the diurnal component of these aspects; nocturnal patterns are less known. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing diel movement patterns in ecologically and commercially important nocturnal coral reef fishes. We evaluate 122-days of acoustic telemetry data from 4 nocturnal species in 2 coral reef fish families (Haemulidae and Lutjanidae) on the Great Barrier Reef. For all species, we found a clear division between daytime resting areas on the reef and a move towards off-reef areas at night. This was highlighted in the low number of detections at night and the high average transitions between receivers at twilight. Over our study period, average nocturnal space use area (minimum convex polygon) of Plectorhincus gibbosus was 328,089 m2, Plectorhincus lineatus 28,828 m2, and Lutjanus carponotatus 20,369 m2. However, results from a Principal Component Analysis revealed that space use, and movement, varied substantially within species; for 3 of the 4 species the main axis of variation correlated with individual-level behaviour. These large differences in individual space use patterns highlight the need for caution when using species averages when considering ecosystem functions. Overall, our preliminary observations provide a glimpse into the large spatial extent, potential habitat connectivity, and intra and interspecific variation in activity patterns among large nocturnal Indo-Pacific reef fishes. This highlights their potential importance in maintaining ecosystem links between coral reefs and adjacent habitats.","[Collins, William P.; Bellwood, David R.; Morais, Renato A.; Siqueira, Alexandre C.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Morais, Renato A.] Univ Paris Sci & Lettres, CRIOBE, UAR3278, Perpignan, France; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Marine Data Technol Hub, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Waltham, Nathan J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Trop Water & Aquat Ecosyst Res TropWATER, Douglas, Qld, Australia; [Siqueira, Alexandre C.] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Sch Sci, Perth, WA, Australia",James Cook University; Universite PSL; James Cook University; James Cook University; Edith Cowan University,"Collins, WP (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Res Hub Coral Reef Ecosyst Funct, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",william.collins@my.jcu.edu.au,"Siqueira, Alexandre/AAJ-5987-2020; Araujo, Renato/AAA-7903-2021; Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011","Collins, William/0000-0001-8390-6526; Waltham, Nathan/0000-0003-0058-773X; Siqueira, Alexandre C./0000-0001-7970-4024","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council [CE140100020, FL190100062]; Australian Research Council (DRB); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council (DRB)(Australian Research Council); Vice Chancellor's Research Fellowship by Edith Cowan University; Branco Weiss Fellowship; PSL Junior Fellowship","We thank Joanna A.

The horizontal space use and vertical space use of two exploited reef fish, Plectropomus leopardus and P. laevis (all adults), were compared at mid-shelf Helix Reef and Lodestone Reef in the Great Barrier Reef over similar to 3 years using passive acoustic telemetry. Both species were detected throughout the 12-month duration of transmitters (mean detection period: similar to 270 days) and often made deep movements to similar to 40 m possibly related to reproductive behaviour (spawning). Differences in space use were apparent between species, with P. laevis consistently using greater area around reefs throughout the year. Overall, depth use patterns were similar between species; however, when daily detections were grouped in 2-h periods, P. laevis remained shallower and had greater variation in depth use compared to P. leopardus. Contrasting patterns of space use between these co-occurring species, in conjunction with known dietary dissimilarities, indicate distinct habitat use and resource preferences that are important for conservation and fisheries management.","[Matley, J.

Acoustic tagging and tracking of 84 Lethrinus nebulosus in the Ningaloo Marine Park indicated that sizes of individual habitat utilisation kernels were similar across diel and tidal cycles, but varied greatly among individuals. Clearly differentiated diel and tidal habitat use patterns were evident in significant proportions of individuals, particularly in relation to tidal phase. For the majority of residents, home-range sizes were reasonably stable over periods of 2-4 years, but in some cases core areas did shift over time. At seasonal time scales, peaks of seasonal activity and home range area were recorded during spawning season (October-December). Long-distance return migrations to spawning locations were observed that were among the longest observed for any reef fish (over 130km). Suspected spawning-related movements were recorded almost exclusively in fish >500-mm fork length, and were semilunar, following quarter moons in October-December. Significant individual-level variability in movement and habitat use patterns, evident across multiple temporal scales, has important implications for the management of L. nebulosus populations.","[Babcock, R.

In typical fishery management efforts, fish populations are often treated as homogeneous units, thereby tacitly ignoring potential intrapopulation variation within taxonomic groupings. We used acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis to examine movement patterns of 20 gray snapper Lutjanus griseus and 20 schoolmaster snapper L. apodus in a Bahamian tidal creek and wetland. In particular, we examined (1) if intrapopulation variation in fish habitat use and movement patterns existed, (2) whether that variation was a function of body size, and (3) if there was evidence of specialization in habitat use among individuals. We found that movement varied substantially among individuals, but was independent of body size. Some individuals exhibited frequent, repeated, movements to certain areas of the study site. delta C-13 values of individual snapper were significantly related to movement metrics, suggesting that movement differences were related to specific patterns of foraging behavior. Our findings suggest the importance of incorporating intrapopulation niche variation-a source of variation that is often overlooked in traditional conservation and management strategies-into the study of coastal fish populations.","[Hammerschlag-Peyer, Caroline M.; Layman, Craig A.] Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, Dept Biol Sci, N Miami, FL 33181 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Hammerschlag-Peyer, CM (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, N Miami, FL 33181 USA.",cpeye001@fiu.edu,,,"NSF OCE [0746164]; NSF DEB [0842196]; MacTaggart Third Fund, Friends of the Environment (Abaco); Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences [0842196] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF OCE(National Science Foundation (NSF)); NSF DEB(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); MacTaggart Third Fund, Friends of the Environment (Abaco); Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation; Division Of Environmental Biology; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO))","This project was conducted as part of a broad educational outreach program funded by NSF OCE #0746164, NSF DEB #0842196, the MacTaggart Third Fund, Friends of the Environment (Abaco), and the Bahamas Reef Environmental Education Foundation.

Determining reef fish habitat utilization patterns from passive acoustic arrays is challenging for the following reasons: (i) habitat classifications must be meaningful to the species, (ii) the array must contain the species' home range, and (iii) the probability of detection may differ among habitats within the array. We conducted a multi-year tracking study in the marine protected areas (MPAs) of Dry Tortugas, Florida, using a calibrated passive acoustic array deployed over habitats classified by type (reef, rubble, sand), rugosity (high, medium, low relief), and patchiness (contiguous, spur-and-groove, isolated). Our design controlled for differences between individuals, diel and edge effects, and detection gaps resulting from the nonlinear relationship between acoustic tag detection probabilities as a function of distance from the receiver. We found red and black groupers preferred high-relief reef habitats, whereas mutton and yellowtail snappers preferred low-relief contiguous reef habitats. By identifying critical habitats for exploited species, our analysis may facilitate more efficient fishery-independent sampling and MPA designs.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NOAA, Southeast Reg Off, 263 13th Ave South, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007","National Park Service CESU [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA17RJ1226, NA08OAR4320892]; American Society for Electrical Engineering; Dry Tortugas National Park; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; US Geological Survey; Stock Island Oceanside Marina; Andy Griffiths Charters of Key West, Florida; University of Miami","National Park Service CESU; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); American Society for Electrical Engineering; Dry Tortugas National Park; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; US Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Stock Island Oceanside Marina; Andy Griffiths Charters of Key West, Florida; University of Miami","This research was primarily supported by National Park Service CESU contract H5000065040-J5281060165 and NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program grants NA17RJ1226 and NA08OAR4320892.

To improve this situation for reef fishes, we introduced a novel response variable method that treats signal detections as proportions (i.e., percent transmissions detected or detection rates) and compared this against prior approaches to examine the influence of array and transmitter performance, signal distance and environmental factors on detection rates. We applied this method to tagged snappers and groupers in the Florida reef ecosystem and controlled range-tests on static targets in Bayboro Harbor, Florida, to provide methodological guidance for the planning and evaluation of passive array studies for coral reef fishes. Results: Logistic regression analysis indicated detection rates were primarily a non-linear function of tag distance from receiver. A 'model-weighted' function was developed to incorporate the non-linear relationship between detection rate and distance to provide robust positioning estimates and allow for easy extension to tags with different ping rates. Conclusions: Optimal acoustic array design requires balancing the interplay between receiver spacing, detection rates, and positioning error. Spacing receivers at twice the distance of the modeled 50% detection rate may be appropriate when quantification of overall space use is a priority, and would provide a minimum of 75% detection rate. However, for research where missing detections within the array is unacceptable or time-at-arrival based fine-scale positioning is needed, tighter receiver spacing may be required to maintain signal detection probability near 100%.","[Farmer, Nicholas A.; Ault, Jerald S.; Smith, Steven G.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Farmer, Nicholas A.] NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Reg Off, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Franklin, Erik C.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Sch Ocean & Earth Sci & Technol, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Farmer, NA (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",nick.farmer@noaa.gov,"Franklin, Erik/ABC-1088-2020; Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007; Franklin, Erik/0000-0002-8660-3085",National Park Service [H5000065040-J5281060165]; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grant [NA17RJ1226]; American Society for Engineering Education's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Glenda Kelley; Scott Donahue; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; United States Geological Survey; Stock Island Oceanside Marina,National Park Service; NOAA NMFS Coral Reef Conservation Program Grant(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); American Society for Engineering Education's National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; University of Miami Doctoral Fellowship; Florida Foundation for Responsible Angling; International Light Tackle Tournament Association; International Women's Fishing Association Ryan Kelley Memorial Scholarship; Marine Technology Society; PADI Project AWARE; SEASPACE; Yamaha Contender Miami Billfish Tournament; University of Miami Small Boats Program; Yankee Fleet of Key West; Costa del Mar; National Marine Fisheries Service; Glenda Kelley; Scott Donahue; Calloway Family; American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists; United States Geological Survey(United States Geological Survey); Stock Island Oceanside Marina,"The authors thank Dry Tortugas National Park; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary; the captains of Andy Griffiths Charters of Key West, Florida; D.B.

Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; James Cook University,"Currey, LM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Leanne.Currey@my.jcu.edu.au,"Currey-Randall, Leanne/AAS-8975-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Williams, Ashley/ABA-5921-2020; Williams, Ashley/G-2017-2014","Williams, Ashley/0000-0002-5530-0073; Currey-Randall, Leanne M/0000-0002-3772-1288; Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Australian Research Council; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences; AIMS@JCU Postgraduate Research Scholarship,"We thank the staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group for assisting with this project, particularly A.

The present study examined spatial and dietary overlap between two co-occurring reef fish, namely Plectropomus leopardus and P. maculatus, at an inshore reef in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park using acoustic telemetry and stable isotopes. Movements of tagged fish within an acoustic array of 19 receivers deployed along a narrow reef portion of Orpheus Island were monitored for up to 3 years. Although space use was similar between species, spatial overlap was rare and P. maculatus (n = 30) was consistently deeper than P. leopardus (n = 32). Dietary overlap between species was high based on overlapping delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotopic niches in muscle tissue (n = 20). The complementary stable isotope and acoustic telemetry data revealed these species had similar isotopic niches but distinct space use patterns, which may be a product of competition for resources. These findings show species-specific behaviours within a genus commonly managed or reported as a single entity, and provide new information on partitioning of resources by Plectropomus spp. in inshore reef environments.","[Matley, J.

Understanding species movement patterns is a key component to identifying if a species will benefit from marine protected areas. Acoustic telemetry methods coupled with a GIS were used to quantify the home range, site fidelity, and habitat use of barred sand bass at the Catalina Marine Science Center Marine Life Refuge located at Santa Catalina Island, California. Barred sand bass utilized soft-sediment habitats within close proximity to rocky reefs and had home ranges that averaged 10,003 m(2) +/- 4773 m(2) (+/- SD). During the clay, individuals generally used multiple areas on or near reefs, and at night repeatedly used one area over soft-sediment habitat. Fifty percent of the acoustically tagged individuals exhibited year round fidelity to the study site indicating that even small marine protected areas may be an effective management strategy.

The occurrence patterns of the target fishes both inside and outside the MPA were also observed. Thirty individuals from 6 species (20.2 to 41.4 cm fork length) were caught, acoustically tagged and released inside the MPA, and 4 to 210 d of tracking data were then obtained from 28 detected fishes. Lutjanus monostigma, Lethrinus atkinsoni, and Lethrinus obsoletus were found to mostly inhabit the coral reef. The remaining 3 species (Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Lethrinus harak, and Siganus guttatus) utilized both coral and seagrass habitats but showed different patterns: Lutjanus argentimaculatus visited seagrass only at night; Lethrinus harak occurred in the coral reef more at night than in the day, showing the opposite pattern in seagrass; and S. guttatus exhibited the converse pattern to L. harak. More than one-third of the tracked individuals moved inside and outside the MPA more than once per day on average during the tracking period. However, 95.4% of detections were recorded by acoustic receivers deployed inside the MPA. Underwater visual surveys revealed that the densities of some target fishes were significantly higher inside than outside the MPA.

The monitored area enclosed a natural rocky reef, an adjacent artificial reef (AR) and shallower sandy bottoms. Most of the fish were close to full time residents in the monitored area. Results revealed that D. sargus use the natural reef areas on a more frequent basis than the AR. However, excursions to the adjacent AR and sandy bottoms were frequently detected, essentially during daytime.

In the Caribbean, populations of Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus have declined due to fishing impacts on spawning aggregations. Despite local and regional efforts by fisheries managers to implement regulations protecting spawning aggregations, few Nassau grouper populations appear to be recovering. In order to improve management strategies for this critically endangered species, it is necessary to understand the spatial ecology of the species across seasons and years. In the Cayman Islands, we used a multi-year, presence/absence, depth-coded acoustic tagging dataset of Nassau grouper to characterize patterns in the species' behavior and vertical habitat use at home reef sites. Twenty acoustically tagged individuals (56-84 cm, 70.01 +/- 7.40 cm; total length, mean +/- SD) maintained consistent home reef sites, although some fish regularly shifted activity centers within the home site, often following a seasonal spawning migration. Seven fish with depth-coded tags showed a higher probability of vertical movement in the hours immediately following dawn and preceding dusk. We found evidence of a positive relationship between the fish condition factor and depth of home reef site. The finding of persistent home reef sites across years suggests that properly sized spatial reserves at home reef sites can be a useful complement to spawning aggregation protection when considering management strategies for Nassau grouper.","[Blincow, Kayla M.; Stevens-McGeever, Sierra J.; Semmens, Brice X.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Bush, Phillippe G.; McCoy, Croy M.; Johnson, Bradley C.] Cayman Isl Govt, Dept Environm, KY1-1002, Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands; [Heppell, Scott A.; Heppell, Selina S.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Pattengill-Semmens, Christy, V; Whaylen, Leslie] Reel Environm Educ Fdn REEF, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA; [Whaylen, Leslie] NOAA, Flower Garden Banks Natl Marine Sanctuary, Galveston, TX 77551 USA; [Luke, Kirsten] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Atlantic Coast Joint Venture, Panama City, FL 32405 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Oregon State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; US Fish & Wildlife Service,"Semmens, BX (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",bsemmens@ucsd.edu,,"Blincow, Kayla/0000-0003-3944-5317",Lenfest Ocean Program; Disney Conservation Fund; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration International Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA04NOS4630287]; P.

It is essential to understand the degrees to which platforms support fish over time to indicate whether biological requirements (e.g., shelter, diet, reproduction) are being met. To determine the ecological importance of platforms as fish habitat, the site fidelity and depth/habitat use of adult cabezon, Scorpaenichthys marmoratus (Ayres, 1854), grass rockfish, Sebastes rastrelliger (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880), kelp rockfish, Sebastes atrovirens (Jordan and Gilbert, 1880), and California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher (Ayres, 1854) were investigated at platforms Edith (50 m bottom depth) and Eureka (212 m). A total of 63 fish were acoustically tagged and monitored for up to 578 d. Sixty-three percent of individuals were still present at platforms at the end of the study (long-term site fidelity), with 55 individuals detected a mean of 66.9% (SD 36.0%) of their total days at liberty (daily site fidelity). All species displayed a shift in seasonal depth use. The shallowest horizontal level, consisting of various horizontal beams at platform Edith (15 m depth) and Eureka (17 m), was the most utilized habitat by grass rockfish, kelp rockfish, and California sheephead. Cabezon at platform Eureka utilized depths (21-31 m) unassociated with horizontal levels, while at platform Edith they primarily utilized the second horizontal level (30 m). Decommissioning options that remove the shallowest 26 m of structure would eliminate the habitat most utilized by three of the four study species that dominate the nearshore reef fish communities at SPS platforms.","[Mireles, Carlos; Martin, Christopher J.

Defining ecological roles is challenging in complex ecosystems such as coral reefs. While it is well known that multiple reef-associated shark species coexist on a single reef, their patterns of space use and interactions have been difficult to define. Here we used acoustic telemetry data to analyse activity space, depth use and spatial networks to examine the interplay of these species relative to their roles in coral reef ecosystems. Integration of multiple analyses revealed that species with similar sizes and similar diets displayed clear spatial segregation, both between habitats and depth. This distribution is likely to reduce competition for prey among these species. In contrast, species that are dietary generalists or that have unique diets moved more broadly and overlapped with all other species. These results suggest competition for prey may be a driving factor in the distribution and space use of reef-associated sharks, revealing complex, interdependent functional roles within these systems. Results of this analysis demonstrate the advanced information that can be obtained through application of multiple methods and directed, simultaneous study of multiple species.","[Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.; Ledee, Elodie J.

Despite this important ecological role, we have a poor understanding of the movement patterns of such large herbivorous fish, including Kyphosus bigibbus. Nineteen K. bigibbus captured near adjacent but distinct patch reefs were tagged with internal acoustic tags and their movements monitored for up to 20 months by an array of 60 acoustic receivers. Home-range estimates showed that movements of individuals from each patch reef encompassed different spatial extents and resulted in differences in habitat used by the two groups of fish. The average 50 and 95% kernel utilisation distribution for long-term resident fish was 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 1.61 +/- 0.30 km(2) respectively, ranges that represent the largest values for a herbivorous coral reef fish recorded to date. There was a significantly higher degree of fidelity among fish from the same school, and to particular patch reefs, despite the proximity of the reefs and substantial overlap between schools of conspecifics. A coefficient of sociality was used on pairs of fish and showed that there was no evidence that individuals were consistently detected together when they were detected by receivers away from their home reef. The variability of movement patterns among individuals of K. bigibbus results in an increased niche footprint for this important browser, potentially increasing reef resilience.","[Pillans, R.

Leopard coralgrouper Plectropomus leopardus is one of the main targeted fishery species in the Great Barrier Reef; however, there is no information on long-term movement patterns based on continuous and frequent data points. The objective of this study was to determine long-term space use of P. leopardus and identify any seasonal variation in movement trends. A total of 124 P. leopardus were implanted with V13P acoustic transmitters between 2010 and 2012 and passively tracked. Forty-five VR2W receivers were deployed at 2 reefs to track the movements of tagged individuals. The influence of time of day, season, tagging year, location, and water temperature on several movement measures was investigated. Of the 124 fish tagged, 74 individuals had sufficient detections to be included in analysis of horizontal movement, and 55 were used to analyse vertical movements. Results showed increased horizontal movements and higher activity in deeper water during the day in the austral summer. Movement patterns, both vertically and horizontally, appeared to be influenced by water temperature, but also corresponded with spawning season. Despite increased movements during summer, individuals typically remained in a small area similar to 0.5 km(2) throughout detection periods, indicating that long-range spawning-related movements are rare and that adequate resources are obtained within a small section of habitat year-round. This study provides long-term (similar to 3 yr) movement data for an economically significant reef fish and increases knowledge of spatial and temporal space use patterns.","[Matley, J.

Pre-spawning cod were tagged (200 DSTs, 26 acoustic tags) as they neared a known spawning ground. Fish equipped with acoustic tags were relocated by a receiver array and a boat-mounted directional receiver over the following eight weeks. Group activity was analyzed by minimum convex polygon (MCP), and individual kernel distribution estimates were created for 13 fish. Individual cod utilized spawning areas <60 km(2) in size (mean 41 km(2)) with a high degree of spatial overlap. Activity was distributed along a roughly V-shaped corridor bounded by elevated bottom features. Cod aggregated around specific humps and ridges, and there were two separate weeks during the two-month study when the majority of cod converged on a single aggregation hot-spot. The last detection date for each cod was used as a proxy for departure date. Seven cod were tracked making rapid departures across the spawning ground in <24 h. Residence on the spawning ground ranged from 8 to 53 days (mean 30 days). Residence time was confirmed by DST data. Of the 26 recaptured cod whose DSTs were analyzed, 14 cod were observed to make clear deep-water (>100 m) shifts occurring 23-50 days after tagging. Data from three cod equipped with both an acoustic transmitter and a DST showed concurrence between last detections and deep-water shifts. Our findings demonstrate that coastal cod in the western Gulf of Maine aggregate around fine-scale bathymetric features on the spawning ground, utilize relatively small areas during spawning, are highly mobile within those areas, and tend to move as a group.

However, most evidence of such movement has been inferred from density and size structure differences among these habitats in tropical waters. The aim of the present Study was to directly evaluate multiple habitat use by an ecologically and economically important reef fish, the gray snapper Lutjanus griseus, in subtropical waters. An integrated set of activities was conducted, including tagging and tracking of individuals and underwater video photography to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of movements among neighboring mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitats in the northern Florida Keys, USA. Results of ultrasonic acoustic and mini-archival tagging indicated that L. griseus exhibits: (1) a distinct diel migration pattern, whereby shallow seagrass beds; are frequented nocturnally and mangroves and other habitats with complex structure are occupied diurnally, and (2) bay-to-ocean movement, occurring during the known spawning season of L. griseus in this region. Video photography confirmed diel movement among seagrass and mangrove habitats. Results of this subtropical study corroborate direct and indirect evidence obtained in tropical waters of multiple inshore habitat use by L. griseus, as well as its seasonal movement into or towards offshore reefs. For resource managers charged with designing and implementing management plans for subtropical coastal habitats and fisheries, our findings provide direct support for the strategy of conserving both inshore seagrass and mangrove habitats as well as offshore coral reefs.","[Luo, Jiangang; Serafy, Joseph E.; Sponaugle, Su; Teare, Paul B.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Serafy, Joseph E.] NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Kieckbusch, David] Milian Swain & Associates Inc, W Palm Beach, FL 33411 USA",University of Miami; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Luo, JG (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Div Marine Biol & Fisheries, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",jluo@rsmas.miami.edu,,,,,,,44,110,124,0,63,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Although most marine protected areas (MPAs) were originally established to protect less mobile organisms, protection of shark species from fishing and other impacts is possible if individuals exhibit high residency and site fidelity within the MPA boundaries. For this study, we used a fixed acoustic telemetry array to study the residency, habitat use, and interspecific space use among 4 shark species in Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), an MPA in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. From June 2013 to May 2017, 11 nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum, 6 lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris, 13 Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi, and 6 tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were monitored in the array. Overall, residency was high for all species, with a mean residency index of 0.52 or higher for each species. Network analysis revealed complex inter- and intraspecific spatial associations among individuals. Community detection algorithms showed that G. cirratum and N. brevirostris frequently used the same areas in BIRNM, selecting for shallow sand and seagrass habitats near linear reefs, while G. cuvier and C. perezi had more individualized space use. C. perezi also exhibited ontogenetic shifts, developing individual territories and using deeper water with increasing body size. This work emphasizes the importance of MPA size, placement, and habitat composition when aiming to protect highly mobile species with potentially large home ranges and shifting space use throughout their life histories.","[Casselberry, Grace A.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Finn, John T.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [DeAngelis, Bryan M.] Nature Conservancy, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, St Croix, VI USA; [Lundgren, Ian] NOAA Fisheries, Pacific Isl Reg Off, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Nature Conservancy; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries,"Casselberry, GA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gcasselberry@umass.edu,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Casselberry, Grace/0000-0002-7572-7584; Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011",Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14]; New England Aquarium's Marine Conservation Action Fund; Atlantic White Shark Conservancy; National Park Service,Puerto Rico Sea Grant; New England Aquarium's Marine Conservation Action Fund; Atlantic White Shark Conservancy; National Park Service,"This project was funded in part by Puerto Rico Sea Grant (R-101-2-14), The New England Aquarium's Marine Conservation Action Fund, The Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, and The National Park Service.

This study tested the effect of release density on emigration, activity patterns, and space utilization by releasing juvenile mulloway (Sciaenidae: Argyrosomus japonicus) at low and high densities and monitoring movement intensively for 336h post release. Mulloway released at high densities had faster emigration and greater overall emigration rates than low density releases. Also, mulloway released at high densities used sub-optimal habitats at a greater frequency. Released fish dispersed into habitat patches at densities proportional to the quality of the habitat patch, consistent with density-dependent habitat selection. Targeting releases of small numbers of fish to the carrying capacity of individual patches of habitat will contribute to the success and economic viability of release programs in open systems. Releases of high densities of individuals or repeated releases at the same site may lead to increased emigration and losses from the stocked system. The capacity of a target habitat to support released fish can be rapidly assessed using pilot releases and intensive monitoring of acoustically tagged fish, prior to the implementation of large-scale release programs.","[Taylor, Matthew D.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.; Fairfax, Andrew V.; Suthers, Iain M.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Fairfax, Andrew V.; Suthers, Iain M.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; University of New South Wales Sydney; Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Taylor, MD (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",matt.taylor@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Suthers, Iain/C-4559-2008","Suthers, Iain/0000-0002-9340-7461",Recreational Fishing Trust [L40],Recreational Fishing Trust,"The authors would like to thank the following in their help in the field: T.

To successfully parameterise assessments and design management strategies for exploited fish populations, knowledge and consideration of their movement patterns are essential. Since the efficacy of management approaches vary depending on the sedentary or mobile nature of the target species, presence, space use and depth utilisation were examined to understand the movement patterns of redthroat emperor Lethrinus miniatus. Sixty individuals were monitored for up to 12 months in an acoustic array comprising three coral reefs, and variation in space use and movement patterns was observed among 26 individuals. Half of the individuals were recorded only in proximity of one receiver along the reef edge, while the other half were detected at multiple receivers and used horizontal areas of approximately 4 km(2). Periods of non-detection and lower detection frequency at night (chi (1) (2) = 342.157, P < 0.001) indicated individuals may move away from the monitored reef edge to the adjacent sandy habitat, but most movements outside the array remain unknown. Long-distance movement was recorded for one individual, recaptured similar to 160 km from the release location. Generally, no trends in depth use were apparent, L. miniatus inhabited a variety of depths, which were not related to individual size or time of day, yet some effect of month was evident. Variation in movement among adult L. miniatus indicates that while some individuals undergo broader-scale movement, spatial closures that cover individual reefs (> 4 km(2)) could provide protection from fishing for the proportion of the population that displayed high site fidelity and moderate-sized activity spaces (over a period of up to 12 months).","[Currey, Leanne M.] James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Currey, Leanne M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Williams, Ashley J.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Williams, Ashley J.] Secretariat Pacific Commun, Ocean Fisheries Programme, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University,"Currey, LM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",Leanne.Currey@my.jcu.edu.au,"Currey-Randall, Leanne/AAS-8975-2020; Williams, Ashley/ABA-5921-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Williams, Ashley/G-2017-2014","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332; Currey-Randall, Leanne M/0000-0002-3772-1288; Williams, Ashley/0000-0002-5530-0073",Australian Research Council; James Cook University (JCU) School of Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES); AIMS@JCU,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); James Cook University (JCU) School of Earth and Environmental Sciences (SEES); AIMS@JCU,"We thank the staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group for assisting with this project, particularly A.

The movement behavior of coral reef fish is a complex mechanism that is highly linked to species life-history traits, predation risk and food resources. We used passive acoustic telemetry to study monthly, daily and hourly movement patterns and space use in two species, Schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus) and Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride). We investigated the spatial overlap between the two species and compared intra-specific spatial overlap between day and night. Presence-absence models showed different diel presence and habitat use patterns between the two species. We constructed a spatial network of the movement patterns, which showed that for both species when fish were detected by the array of receivers most movements were made around the coral reef habitat while occasionally moving to silt habitats. Our results show that most individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations and habitat types, although individual behavioral changes were observed for some individuals across time. Our study also highlights the necessity to consider multiple species during MPA implementation and to take into account the specific biological and ecological traits of each species. The low number of fish detected within the receiver array, as well as the intraspecific variability observed in this study, highlight the need to compare results across species and individuals to be used for MPA management.

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to determine home ranges of six adult L. analis, including diel patterns, in Brewers Bay, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. Understanding long-term space use, including site fidelity and habitat usage, is necessary to implement effective and appropriate management actions for a species with extensive space and resource needs.ResultsIndividual L. analis were tracked over an average period of 316 days (range 125-509 days) and showed high site fidelity to relatively small home ranges (meanSD: 0.103 +/- 0.028 km(2), range 0.019-0.190 km(2)) and core use areas with low overlap among individuals. Most home ranges had a habitat composition dominated by seagrass and to a lesser degree, coral reef and/or pavement. Nighttime activity spaces were distinct from but contained within daytime areas. Conclusions: Mutton snapper showed strong site fidelity to home ranges in Brewers Bay. Two individuals that were absent from the array for more than a few hours were detected at separate arrays at spawning aggregation sites. This study expands upon knowledge of mutton snapper home range characteristics, highlights the importance of maintaining adjacent high-quality habitat types in any spatial management plan, and encourages the adoption of other types of management strategies, particularly for transient-aggregating species.","[Heidmann, Sarah L.; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Jossart, Jonathan] CSS, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Kimble, Melissa] Univ Maine, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Orono, ME 04469 USA","University of the Virgin Islands; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

Despite their increased use in recent years, the choice of structures used at artificial reefs remains largely haphazard due to the lack of information on reef structure performance. Few studies have examined the use of different artificial reef structures by individual fish. From 2021-2022, we acoustically tagged 72 black sea bass (Centropristis striata), 34 gag (Mycteroperca mircrolepis), 27 greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), nine almaco jack (S. rivoliana), and eight red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) on four artificial reef complexes near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, U.S. Available artificial reef structures consisted of materials of various sizes and heights made of concrete and metal. We tracked tagged fish using a fine-scale positioning system for similar to 100 days. Black sea bass exhibited high site fidelity to the artificial structure where we caught them, rarely moving away from that structure. The limited movement resulted in low transition probabilities; we conclude that black sea bass do not select for particular artificial structures. Gag and red snapper moved greater distances away from artificial structures and routinely moved between them. Greater amberjack and almaco jack moved the most within the complexes displaying circling behavior around individual structures and were the only species that regularly moved off the artificial reef complexes. Greater amberjack movements away from artificial sites were most commonly directed to surrounding shipwrecks. Whereas gag, red snapper, almaco jack, and greater amberjack used all available structures, they consistently selected for high relief structures, such as vessels, more than other structures. These results will be useful to managers charged with decisions on what types of structures to place at artificial reef complexes to supplement or enhance habitat for economically important fishes.","[Tharp, Ryan M.; Buckel, Jeffrey A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, Morehead City, NC 27695 USA; [Hostetter, Nathan J.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, North Carolina Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, US Geol Survey, Raleigh, NC USA; [Paxton, Avery B.; Taylor, J.

This is particularly relevant for defining what factors are driving the presence, location, and movements of individuals. The long-term movement and space use patterns of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, were examined on a whole of reef scale in the southern Great Barrier Reef to define whether movement and activity space varied through time. Twenty-nine C. amblyrhynchos were tracked for over 2 years to define movement patterns. All individuals showed high residency within the study site, but also had high roaming indices. This indicated that individuals remained in the region and used all of the monitored habitat (i.e., the entire reef perimeter). Use of space was consistent through time with high reuse of areas most of the year. Therefore, individuals maintained discrete home ranges, but undertook broader movements around the reef at times. Mature males showed greatest variation in movement with larger activity spaces and movement into new regions during the mating season (August-September). Depth use patterns also differed, suggesting behaviour or resource requirements varied between sexes. Examination of the long-term, reef-scale movements of C. amblyrhynchos has revealed that reproductive activity may play a key role in space use and activity patterns. It was unclear whether mating behaviour or an increased need for food to sustain reproductive activity and development played a greater role in these patterns. Reef shark movement patterns are becoming more clearly defined, but research is still required to fully understand the biological drivers for the observed patterns.","[Heupel, M.

Active acoustic tracking was used to investigate movements and habitat use of juvenile (683 +/- 58 mm total length; mean +/- SD) blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus at Orpheus Island, Australia. Six juveniles were tracked by foot and boat for over 62 h. Juveniles moved in synchrony with tidal cycles, always remaining within very shallow (<1 m) sandy reef flat or reef crest waters during outgoing, low and incoming tides, and using inundated mangrove habitat during higher tides, indicating that tidal fluctuations were a major driver of movement and habitat use. Individuals never left the bay where they were captured or entered deep water beyond the fringing reef, restricting their movements within water <60 cm deep. In general, linearity and rate of movement were significantly higher during incoming or outgoing tides, whereas these measures were significantly lower during higher tide heights when juveniles were occupying mangrove habitats. The observed behaviour was most likely a predator-avoidance strategy, highlighting the importance of mangrove root habitat use by juvenile blacktip reef sharks in coastal nursery areas and indicating that this may be an essential habitat for the young of this species.","[George, Lachlan W.; Martins, Ana P.

To provide baseline data for the assessing these impacts on fisheries, we tracked the movements of Japanese spiny lobsters (Panulirus japonicus), a commercially important species, using acoustic telemetry in an area that was designated by the government as a promotion zone for OWF development. Acoustic tags were attached to 23 adult lobsters (CL = 97.9 f 17.7 mm), which were then released in an isolated rocky reef frequently used by local fishermen as a lobster fishing ground. The tagged lobsters were detected within the reef for 7-97 (mean f SD = 52 f 29) days, with five individuals remaining within the reef > 90 days. The duration of home-area occupancy during which lobsters likely occupied the same or adjacent shelters within the reef ranged 2-42 (mean f SD = 5.7 f 5.8) days. Movement network analyses revealed that lobsters often relocated shelters both within and between habitat patches, with some traveling over 1-km per night to reach another patch. These findings suggest that if OWF structures function as new habitats for this species, the structures' introduction could alter the lobsters' spatial distribution and movement network. We believe that a comparative approach examining the space use of commercial species before and after OWF development is essential for determining the precise impacts of OWF introduction on local fisheries.","[Sasaki, Ikusei] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Matsumoto, Yuki; Takeda, Munenari; Matsushita, Yoshiki; Nakamura, Itsumi; Kawabe, Ryo] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Sci & Technol, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Matsushita, Yoshiki] Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 1-7 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Nakamura, Itsumi; Kawabe, Ryo] Nagasaki Univ, Inst East China Sea Res, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 1551-7 Taira Machi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan",Nagasaki University; Nagasaki University; Nagasaki University; Nagasaki University,"Sasaki, I (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan.",sasaiku3319@gmail.com,,,"Organization for Marine Science and Technology, Nagasaki University; Saikai City","Organization for Marine Science and Technology, Nagasaki University; Saikai City","This study was supported by Joint Research between the Organization for Marine Science and Technology, Nagasaki University and Saikai City, titled Research on a Cooperative Model between Marine Renew-able Energy and Fisheries.

We also assessed the efficacy of a small sanctuary zone to reduce anthropogenic pressures. Tagged southern eagle rays in Coffin Bay were semi-permanent residents (residency index similar to 0.35), with a seasonal exodus from late autumn to spring, high residency from mid-spring to mid-autumn, and selection of Kellidie Bay (located within Coffin Bay). Most (67%) rays were detected in the Kellidie Bay Sanctuary Zone, but spent <15% of their time in Coffin Bay within the sanctuary. Individual variation in the amount of time spent in the Kellidie Bay Sanctuary Zone was high, ranging 0-42%. In contrast, tagged southern eagle rays along the Fleurieu Peninsula had high site fidelity throughout the year (residency index similar to 85%).

This study used the horizontal movements of acoustically tagged Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) to examine their use of coastal space around the Cayman Islands between 2009 and 2019. A total of 39 (59.1%) tagged sharks (male = 22, female = 17, immature = 18, mature = 21) were detected on the islands wide network of acoustic receivers. The detection data were used to calculate values of Residency Index (RI), Site-Fidelity Index (SFI) and minimum linear displacement (MLD), as well as for network analysis of individual shark movements to test for differences between demographics, seasons, and diel periods. Sharks were detected for up to 1,598 days post-tagging and some individuals showed resident behaviour but the majority of tagged individuals appear to have been one-off or only occasional transient visitors to the area. Generally, individuals showed strong site-fidelity to different areas displaying linear home ranges of < 20 km. The evidence indicates that there was no pattern of diel behaviour. Tagged sharks generally showed increased movements within and between islands during the summer (April-September), which may be related to breeding activity. Some individuals even made occasional excursions across 110 km of open water > 2,000 m deep between Grand Cayman and Little Cayman. One mature female shark showed a displacement of 148.21 km, the greatest distance reported for this species. The data shows that the distances over which some sharks moved, greatly exceeded the extent of any one of the islands' marine protected areas indicating that this species may be more mobile and dispersive than previously thought. This study provides support for the blanket protection to all sharks throughout Cayman waters, which was incorporated within the National Conservation Act in 2015.","[Kohler, Johanna; Johnson, Bradley; Austin, Timothy] Cayman Isl Govt, Dept Environm, George Town, Cayman Islands; [Kohler, Johanna; Gore, Mauvis; Ormond, Rupert] Heriot Watt Univ, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Biotechnol, Edinburgh, Scotland; [Gore, Mauvis; Ormond, Rupert] Marine Conservat Int, Edinburgh, Scotland",Heriot Watt University,"Kohler, J (corresponding author), Cayman Isl Govt, Dept Environm, George Town, Cayman Islands.;Kohler, J (corresponding author), Heriot Watt Univ, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Biotechnol, Edinburgh, Scotland.",johanna.k.kohler@gmail.com,,"Kohler, Johanna/0009-0009-8854-5294; Ormond, Rupert/0000-0003-4943-2843","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) under its Darwin Initiative Programme; Ocean Frontiers Ltd.","UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) under its Darwin Initiative Programme; Ocean Frontiers Ltd.","We especially thank Gina Ebanks-Petrie, Director of the Cayman Islands Department of the Environment, for her support of this study and Jeremy Olynik for assistance with ArcGIS maps.

We used acoustic telemetry to examine movement patterns and habitat use of juvenile mangrove whiprays (Himantura granulata) in an intertidal bay at Orpheus Island, Australia. Thirteen juveniles were acoustically monitored between March and December 2012, and in July 2012, four active tracks were completed. The majority of the acoustically monitored rays remained within the intertidal bay for the entire monitoring period. Tidal changes caused rays to move from the inner-bay mangrove (high tide) habitat to coral reef in the outer bay (low tide). Actively tracked rays moved in a directed way during running tides, remaining in shallow water. During periods of high and low tide, when rays refuged in mangrove or reef habitats, movement was limited and sinuosity was high. In mangrove areas, rays were most commonly observed refuging under or close to mangrove roots, and rarely in open sand areas. Refuging behaviour in mangrove and reef habitats suggested that predation risk may be the predominant factor influencing the movement of small rays. The continuous use of intertidal habitats demonstrates their importance to Himantura granulata.","[Davy, Lauren E.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Heupel, Michelle R.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Davy, Lauren E.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Heupel, Michelle R.] James Cook Univ, Sch Earth & Environm, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Davy, LE (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",lauren.davy@gmail.com,"Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",National Environmental Research Program; AIMS@JCU; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences,National Environmental Research Program; AIMS@JCU; James Cook University School of Earth and Environmental Sciences,"We thank the staff and students of the Centre for Sustainable Tropical Fisheries and Aquaculture, especially V.

In this study, we selected 3 species, Sparisoma viride (Scaridae), Acanthurus chirurgus (Acanthuridae), and Lutjanus apodus (Lutjanidae), to quantify their home ranges, evaluate their site fidelity, and identify movement patterns in Martinique (14 degrees 36' N, 61 degrees 32' W). Two complementary tagging methods (external Floy tags and acoustic telemetry) were utilised to monitor movement patterns on different spatial scales from November 2009 to November 2011. We tagged 673 A. chirurgus, 131 L. apodus, and 217 S. viride with Floy tags and 30 A. chirurgus, 47 L. apodus, and 37 S. viride with acoustic tags. The results revealed that several individuals maintained a small preferential site for several months to over a year. Other individuals were able to move long distances (< 9 km) outside the MPA over a short period (< 3 d) and never returned to the MPA. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tagging methods and long-term observations to improve the monitoring of fish movement relative to MPA design and effectiveness. Despite the fragmented habitat in the studied MPA, the results highlight that small MPAs (9.56 km(2)) could protect the 3 studied species. This study also demonstrated that natural barriers (large areas of silt and sand) were crossed by some individuals. Our findings provide relevant information on these species that should be utilised to better inform MPA design and decision-making processes, management, and overall MPA effectiveness.","[Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Garcia, Jessica; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environm Mediterraneens, UMR 5110, F-66860 Perpignan, France; [Rousseau, Yann] CNRS Guyane, USR3456, Cayenne 97300, French Guiana; [Legrand, Helene] DEAL, Cayenne 97306, French Guiana",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; CEFREM; CNRS - National Institute for Earth Sciences & Astronomy (INSU),"Garcia, J (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol Hidrol, Campus Espinardo, E-30100 Murcia, Spain.",jessicagarcia.mpa@gmail.com,"Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009",,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes,"Financial support for this study was provided by Fondation d'entreprise TOTAL and the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes.

While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.","[Marshell, A.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Marshell, A.; Mills, J.

Scientists and managers have sought to understand the effects of artificial reefs on reef fish ecology by focusing on fish residency and movement at artificial reefs with less attention paid to broader spatial and temporal patterns in reef fish movements among a seascape of artificial reefs and other natural habitats. We used novel large-scale (> 15 km(2)) geopositioning acoustic telemetry arrays to track the 3-dimensional movements of tagged red snapper (n = 59) and gray triggerfish (n = 15) among multiple nGOM artificial reefs up to 333 days. Tagged fish moved frequently among artificial reefs and had shorter residence times at the release reef (43 days for red snapper and 3 days for gray triggerfish) than reported in previous studies. Both species displayed high individual variability in movement dynamics, as well as seasonally variable diel patterns of habitat use, height above bottom, and distance to reefs, which may have been driven by dynamic influences of predation risk, physiological constraints, or foraging over time and space. The wider seascape view revealed in this study demonstrates the importance of including multiple artificial reefs over long timescales to capture individual, spatial, and temporal variability in reef fish movement.","[Bohaboy, Erin C.; Patterson, William F.

An example is cleaning symbiosis, which has been observed in terrestrial and marine environments. The most recognized form of marine cleaning symbiosis is that of cleaner fishes and their clients. Cleaner species set up cleaning stations on the reef, and other species seek out their services. However, it is not well understood how the presence of cleaning stations influence movements of large highly mobile species. We examined the role of cleaning stations as a driver of movement and habitat use in a mobile client species. Here, we used a combination of passive acoustic telemetry and in-water surveys to investigate cleaning station attendance by the reef manta ray Mobula alfredi. We employed a novel approach in the form of a fine-scale acoustic receiver array set up around a known cleaning area and tagged 42 rays. Within the array, we mapped structural features, surveyed the distribution of cleaner wrasse, and observed the habitat use of the rays. We found manta ray space use was significantly associated with blue-streak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus distribution and hard coral substrate. Cleaning interactions dominated their habitat use at this site, taking precedence over other life history traits such as feeding and courtship. This study has demonstrated that cleaning symbiosis is a driver for highly mobile, and otherwise pelagic, species to visit inshore reef environments. We suggest that targeted and long-term use of specific cleaning stations reflects manta rays having a long-term memory and cognitive map of some shallow reef environments where quality cleaning is provided. We hypothesize that animals prefer cleaning sites in proximity to productive foraging regions.","[Armstrong, Asia O.; Armstrong, Amelia J.; Bennett, Michael B.; Dudgeon, Christine L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.; Everett, Jason D.] Univ Queensland, Sch Math & Phys, Ctr Applicat Nat Resource Math CARM, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.; Everett, Jason D.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Queensland Biosci Precinct QBP, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Townsend, Kathy A.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci Technol & Engn, Hervey Bay, Qld, Australia; [Everett, Jason D.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hays, Graeme C.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [Pederson, Hugh] Innovasea, Hobart, Tas, Australia",University of Queensland; University of Queensland; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of the Sunshine Coast; University of New South Wales Sydney; Deakin University,"Armstrong, AO (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",asia.armstrong@uqconnect.edu.au,"Pederson, Hugh/HTO-8689-2023; Richardson, Anthony/B-3649-2010; Dudgeon, Christine/A-1633-2017; Everett, Jason/C-4557-2008; Townsend, Kathy/K-9486-2016","Pederson, Hugh/0000-0002-0899-2978; Everett, Jason/0000-0002-6681-8054; Townsend, Kathy/0000-0002-2581-2158; Armstrong, Amelia/0000-0001-8103-4314; Armstrong, Asia/0000-0002-9307-0598",Australian Research Council [LP150100669]; University of Queensland Research Scholarships; ARC Discovery Grant [DP190102293]; Australian Research Council [LP150100669] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); University of Queensland Research Scholarships; ARC Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: LP150100669; University of Queensland Research Scholarships; ARC Discovery Grant, Grant/Award Number: DP190102293",,86,13,14,2,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

We performed an acoustic tagging study implemented within the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, Australia, to assess the movement patterns, home range and diel activity of snapper (Chrysophrys auratus; Sparidae); a species of significant recreational and commercial fishing importance in Australia. The study focused on C. auratus movements around Cabbage Tree Island, which is predominantly a no-take sanctuary zone (no fishing), with an array of acoustic stations deployed around the island and adjacent reefs and islands. Thirty C. auratus were tagged with internal acoustic tags in November 2010 with their movements recorded until September 2014. Both adult and juvenile C. auratus were observed to display strong site fidelity to Cabbage Tree Island with a mean 12-month residency index of 0.83 (range = 0 low to 1 high). Only three fish were detected on acoustic receivers away from Cabbage Tree Island, with one fish moving a considerable distance of similar to 290 kms over a short time frame (46 days). The longest period of residency recorded at the island was for three fish occurring regularly at the site for a period of 1249 days. Chrysophrys auratus displayed strong diurnal behaviour and detection frequency was significantly higher during the day than at night; however, there was no significant difference in detection frequency between different hours. This study demonstrates that even small-scale protected areas can benefit C. auratus during multiple life-history stages as it maintains a small home range and displays strong site fidelity over a period of 3 years.","[Harasti, David; Gallen, Christopher] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia; [Lee, Kate A.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Hughes, Julian M.; Stewart, John] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Macquarie University; Sydney Institute of Marine Science; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Harasti, D (corresponding author), NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, Nelson Bay, NSW 2315, Australia.",david.harasti@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Stewart, John/N-7330-2016; Harasti, David/I-1266-2019; Hughes, Julian/D-2695-2017","Hughes, Julian/0000-0002-0884-8386",NSW Recreational Fishing Trust [DPI60],NSW Recreational Fishing Trust,"This study was supported by NSW Recreational Fishing Trust (Project DPI60) (to JS).

We tracked 35 acoustically tagged lionfish for >1 yr (March 2018-May 2019) within a 35 km(2) acoustic array in Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands (an area 10x larger than previous studies). Tracking lionfish at this scale revealed that home range size is 3-20 times larger than previously estimated and varies more than 8-fold across individuals (similar to 48 000-379 000 m(2); average: 101 000 m(2)), with estimates insensitive to assumptions about potential mortality for low-movement individuals. Lionfish move far greater distances than previously reported, with 37% of fish traveling >1 km from the initial tagging site toward deeper habitats, and 1 individual moving similar to 10 km during a 10 d period. Movement rates, home range size, and maximum distance traveled were not related to lionfish size (18-35 cm total length) or lunar phase. Lionfish movement was lowest at night and greatest during crepuscular periods, with fish acceleration (m s(-2)) increasing with water temperature during these times. Our results help reconcile observed patterns of rapid recolonization following lionfish removal, and suggest complex drivers likely result in highly variable patterns of movement for similarly sized fish occupying the same habitat. Culling areas >= the average lionfish home range size identified here (i.e. similar to 10 ha) or habitat patches isolated by >= similar to 180 m (radius of average home range) may minimize subsequent recolonization. If the shallow-deep long-distance movements observed here are unidirectional, mesophotic habitats may require culling at relatively greater frequencies to counteract ongoing migration.","[Green, Stephanie J.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada; [Matley, Jordan K.] St Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Aquat Resources, Antigonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada; [Smith, D.

The 370,200 detections of 57 seabass in the study area revealed high residency in the period from late March-May to September-November, as well as high site fidelity (70.7%). Whereas the majority of seabass left the area in winter, 13 seabass stayed in the harbour experiencing temperatures as low as 2.8 & DEG;C. Two groups of seabass were identified having different core movement areas in the inner and outer harbours, although movement between the two areas was possible. The distinct differences in habitat use between these groups resulted in a significantly different level of exposure to fisheries under the same policy framework. By quantifying the level of protection of seabass, based on the spatiotemporal fisheries management in place, our study underlines the importance of taking into account movement behaviour when evaluating conservation measures.","[Goossens, Jolien; Moens, Tom] Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Goossens, Jolien; Reubens, Jan] Flanders Marine Inst, Marine Observat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [Villagra, Damian; Torreele, Els] Flanders Res Inst Agr Fisheries & Food, Anim Sci Unit, Marine Res Area, ILVO Marine Res, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium; [De Putter, Georges] Sights Nat, B-8490 Jabbeke, Belgium; [Verhelst, Pieterjan] Res Inst Nat & Forest INBO, Aquat Management, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Flanders Marine Institute VLIZ; Institute For Agricultural & Fisheries Research; Research Institute for Nature & Forest,"Goossens, J (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Marine Biol Res Grp, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Goossens, J (corresponding author), Flanders Marine Inst, Marine Observat Ctr, B-8400 Oostende, Belgium.",Jolien.Goossens@UGent.be,"Moens, Tom/AAB-8701-2019; Reubens, Jan/MIN-6043-2025; Verhelst, Pieterjan/I-4864-2019","Verhelst, Pieterjan/0000-0002-2610-6941; Goossens, Jolien/0000-0002-0853-9153",,,,,62,3,3,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

Despite the important top-down pressure this species likely exerts on fish communities within its foraging territories, the specifics of spatial ecology remain relatively unknown. This study tracked 17 great barracuda throughout Buck Island Reef National Monument, a marine-protected area located in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (17.786944 degrees N, - 64.620556 degrees W) from July 2014 to May 2016. Broad- and fine-scale acoustic telemetry was used to examine individual variability and study population patterns in residency, site fidelity, territoriality, and complexity of spatial use within home ranges. Network analysis of broad-scale data revealed spatial and temporal differentiation among the population in location of core use areas and showed that these areas contained multiple unique receiver groups or communities, a product of spatial or temporal variation within core activity spaces. Results from the fine-scale positioning system reinforced spatial and temporal partitioning in core use areas between individuals, indicating territorial behaviors, and showed evidence for both resident and transient movements. Preliminary fine-scale analysis also suggested diel variation in location of activity spaces. Although ubiquitous throughout all shallow water habitats, detection patterns for the study population appear to be influenced by high residency, territoriality, spatial partitioning, and diel variation. Understanding the complexities of individual space use is fundamental to ecologically founded and effective area-based spatial management frameworks at community scales.","[Becker, Sarah L.; Finn, John T.; Novak, Ashleigh J.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI USA; [Lundgren, Ian] NOAA Fisheries, Off Habitat Conservat, Habitat Protect Div, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Becker, SL; Jordaan, A (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",sarah.becker3@gmail.com; ajordaan@eco.umass.edu,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011; Becker, Sarah/0000-0001-5840-6079",University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Park Service; Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14],University of Massachusetts Amherst; National Park Service; Puerto Rico Sea Grant,"This research was funded by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, National Park Service, and Puerto Rico Sea Grant (Project Number R-101-2-14).",,63,13,18,0,30,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Tagged fish displayed three types of diel activity patterns in three different habitats: sand, rocky reefs and matte of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica. Individuals were more active during the day than at night. Overall, white sea bream displayed a remarkable behavioural plasticity in habitat use. Our results indicate that the observed behavioural plasticity in the marine protected area could be the result of multiple ecological and environmental drivers such as size, sex and increased intra-specific competition.

In addition, these techniques rarely allow direct continuous behavioural assessments or the recording of environmental interactions, especially for highly mobile species. Here, we trial a novel method of assessing small-scale movement patterns of marine vertebrates using an unmanned aerial vehicle that could complement longer-term tracking approaches. This approach is unlikely to have behavioural impacts and provides high accuracy and high frequency location data (10 Hz), while subsequently allowing quantitative trajectory analysis. Unmanned aerial vehicle tracking is also relatively low cost compared to single-use acoustic and GPS tags. We tracked 14 sharks for up to 10 min in a shallow lagoon of Heron Island, Australia. Trajectory analysis revealed that Epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) displayed sinusoidal movement patterns, while Blacktip Reef Sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) had more linear trajectories that were similar to those of a Lemon shark (Negaprion acutidens). Individual shark trajectory patterns and movement speeds were highly variable. Results indicate that Epaulette sharks may be more mobile during diurnal low tides than previously thought. The approach presented here allows the movements and behaviours of marine vertebrates to be analysed at resolutions not previously possible without complex and expensive acoustic arrays. This method would be useful to assess the habitat use and behaviours of sharks and rays in shallow water environments, where they are most likely to interact with humans.","[Raoult, Vincent] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, 11 Chittaway Rd, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia; [Raoult, Vincent; Tosetto, Louise; Williamson, Jane E.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2109, Australia; [Tosetto, Louise; Williamson, Jane E.] Macquarie Univ, MQMarine, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Williamson, Jane E.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia",University of Newcastle; Macquarie University; Macquarie University; Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Raoult, V (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, 11 Chittaway Rd, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia.;Raoult, V (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Macquarie Pk, NSW 2109, Australia.",Vincent.raoult@newcastle.edu.au; louise.tosetto@hdr.mq.edu.au; jane.williamson@mq.edu.au,"Williamson, Jane/G-9871-2011; Raoult, Vincent/H-6038-2019","Raoult, Vincent/0000-0001-9459-111X; Tosetto, Louise/0000-0002-8102-579X; Williamson, Jane/0000-0003-3627-4508",Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; University of Newcastle,Department of Biological Sciences at Macquarie University; University of Newcastle,Many thanks to the staff at Heron Island Research Station for their assistance during numerous research trips.

However, site attachment in many reef residents, such as reef sharks, could mean that relocation in response to unfavourable environmental conditions may not be feasible. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to monitor movement and space use of 18 blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus on an inshore reef off the coast of Queensland, Australia, to determine their response to environmental change. Activity space of sharks was modelled against combinations of environmental (wind speed, rain, salinity and water temperature) and biological (size, sex) factors. Size was the most influential predictor of space use, with larger sharks having larger activity spaces. Sex also appeared in top-performing models, showing that juvenile males use more space than juvenile females, although effects were marginal. Model results also indicated a relationship between shark activity space and salinity, where space use increased with decreasing salinity. A similar but weaker relationship was observed with water temperature. These results show that blacktip reef sharks respond to minor changes in salinity, suggesting that they may be able to relocate when conditions are unfavourable, and help define the resilience of this species to disturbance and change.","[Schlaff, Audrey M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Udyawer, Vinay; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Schlaff, Audrey M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Udyawer, Vinay; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.; Udyawer, Vinay] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Schlaff, AM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Schlaff, AM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",audrey.schlaff@my.jcu.edu.au,"Udyawer, Vinay/L-9432-2019; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332; Schlaff, Audrey/0000-0002-2650-5969; Udyawer, Vinay/0000-0001-5812-0740; Simpfendorfer, Colin/0000-0002-0295-2238","Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority [G10/33754.1, G10/33240.1]; JCU's Animal Ethics Committee [A1566]",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program(Australian Government); Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; JCU's Animal Ethics Committee,"We thank staff and students of the Fishing and Fisheries Research Group at James Cook University (JCU) who helped with field efforts, including F. de Faria, S.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness.","[Pittman, Simon J.; Monaco, Mark E.; Kendall, Matthew S.; Poti, Matthew; Clark, Randall D.; Wedding, Lisa M.; Caldow, Chris] US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.; Legare, Bryan; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Islands, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Plymouth, Ctr Marine & Coastal Policy Res, Inst Marine, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Texas Parks & Wildlife, Dickinson Marine Lab, Dickinson, TX USA; [Wedding, Lisa M.] Stanford Univ, Ctr Ocean Solut, Woods Inst Environm, Monterey, CA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands; University of Plymouth; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; Stanford University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), US Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Wedding, Lisa/GRY-3972-2022","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [0814417]; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-31-1-06]; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy [NA09NMF4270068]; NOAA [NA08NOS4260348]; USGS State Partnership Program [07ERAG0078]; Office Of The Director; EPSCoR [0814417] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; University of the Virgin Islands Center for Marine and Environmental Studies (CMES); Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy; NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); USGS State Partnership Program; Office Of The Director; EPSCoR(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"SJP, MEM, AMF and LMW were supported by U.S. National Park Service, NOAA Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA) and NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program.

Hawksbill turtles Eretmo-chelys imbricata are considered a key species in coral reef-associated communities, owing to their specific foraging preferences, yet new information is still revealing details of the spatial and temporal aspects of habitat use. We used passive acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of 18 juvenile hawksbills (minimum curved carapace length: 32.0-59.7 cm, mean +/- SD = 43.9 +/- 6.7 cm) at a developmental foraging site in a Mesoamerican barrier reef, Lighthouse Reef Atoll in Belize (tracking duration 10-1414 d, mean +/- SD = 570 +/- 484 d). Although specific home ranges were difficult to quantify, several turtles showed high site fidelity over timescales of months to years, with occasional wide-ranging use of the atoll. Diel variation in the number of detections received strongly suggest nocturnal resting. Long-term tracking data reveal 3 degrees of site fidelity across the atoll, based on the number of detection days near individual stations: high residency(n = 4 turtles), equential residency (n = 5), and transient behavior (n = 4). These variations in movement raise questions about the differentiation of foraging habitats and degree of individual specialization within this population, as well as the influences of microhabitats and human disturbance.","[Chevis, Megan G.; Godley, Brendan J.] Univ Exeter, Ctr Ecol & Conservat, Penryn Campus, Exeter TR10 9EZ, Devon, England; [Chevis, Megan G.; Lewis, Julie Jackson; Graham, Rachel T.] MarAlliance, 32 Coconut Dr,POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize; [Lewis, James P.] Amphibian Survival Alliance, Int Conservat House,7078 Airlie Rd, Warrenton, VA 20187 USA; [Scales, Kylie L.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Scales, Kylie L.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Ctr, Environm Res Div, 99 Pacific St,Suite 255A, Monterey, CA 93950 USA",University of Exeter; University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Graham, RT (corresponding author), MarAlliance, 32 Coconut Dr,POB 283, San Pedro, Ambergris Caye, Belize.",rachel@maralliance.org,"godley, brendan/A-6139-2009; Scales, Kylie/L-9318-2018","godley, brendan/0000-0003-3845-0034; Chevis, Megan/0000-0002-5996-693X; Scales, Kylie/0000-0003-0843-0956",MarAlliance; Summit Foundation; British Chelonia Group; Wildlife Conservation Society; Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation,MarAlliance; Summit Foundation; British Chelonia Group; Wildlife Conservation Society; Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation,"Support was provided by MarAlliance, The Summit Foundation, British Chelonia Group, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the Mitchell-Petersen Family Foundation.

There is some support for the hypothesis that carcharhinid species that complete their life-cycle within coral reef ecosystems, hereafter referred to as reef sharks'', are more abundant inside no-take marine reserves due to a reduction in fishing pressure (i.e., they benefit from marine reserves). Key predictions of this hypothesis are that (a) individual reef sharks exhibit high site-fidelity to these protected areas and (b) their relative abundance will generally be higher in these areas compared to fished reefs. To test this hypothesis for the first time in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems we combined acoustic monitoring and baited remote underwater video (BRUV) surveys to measure reef shark site-fidelity and relative abundance, respectively. We focused on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi), the most common reef shark in the Western Atlantic, at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve (GRMR), Belize. Acoustically tagged sharks (N = 34) were detected throughout the year at this location and exhibited strong site-fidelity. Shark presence or absence on 200 BRUVs deployed at GRMR and three other sites (another reserve site and two fished reefs) showed that the factor marine reserve'' had a significant positive effect on reef shark presence. We rejected environmental factors or site-environment interactions as predominant drivers of this pattern. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can benefit reef shark populations and we suggest new hypotheses to determine the underlying mechanism(s) involved: reduced fishing mortality or enhanced prey availability.","[Bond, Mark E.; Pikitch, Ellen K.; Chapman, Demian D.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Inst Ocean Conservat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Babcock, Elizabeth A.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Abercrombie, Debra L.] Port Jefferson Stn, New York, NY USA; [Lamb, Norlan F.] Absolondna, Dangriga, Belize",State University of New York (SUNY) System; Stony Brook University; University of Miami,"Bond, ME (corresponding author), SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Inst Ocean Conservat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.",markbond8@gmail.com,"Babcock, Elizabeth/E-7753-2013","Abercrombie, Debra/0000-0002-2572-1862; Babcock, Elizabeth A/0000-0002-2279-6762",Roe Foundation; Pew Charitable Trust,Roe Foundation; Pew Charitable Trust,"Funding: The Roe Foundation; The Pew Charitable Trust (www.pewtrusts.org).

Many of these animals, however, are impossible to observe directly, making it necessary to use indirect methods of observation such as biotelemetry in order to study them. Despite technological advances with tracking equipment enabling movement to be assessed in 3 dimensions, many studies restrict their analyses to traditional 2-dimensional (2D) space use. We compared 2D and 3D (1) core and home range size, (2) home range overlap and (3) changes in space use in relation to biological and environmental variables of a large, demersal reef-dwelling fish species, the eastern blue groper Achoerodus viridis, tracked using passive acoustic telemetry. Mixed effects models were used to determine differences between the core/home range sizes and home range overlap between the sex of the fish and the breeding and non-breeding seasons. The 2D analyses were unable to detect differences in core and home range sizes between the sexes that were successfully identified by the 3D analyses. 2D analyses only detected differences in home range overlap between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, whereas the 3D analyses found seasonal differences according to the sex of the fish.

Their spatial ecology is poorly understood, creating challenges for effective conservation of this enigmatic marine predator. Using acoustic telemetry and network analyses, we describe the movement patterns of 15 mature great hammerhead sharks (207-331.5 cm fork length) primarily within the waters of the southeastern United States from April 2019 to December 2022, including identifying movement corridors, core use areas and seasonal shifts in habitat use. Great hammerheads exhibited partial migration; some sharks undertook consistent, repeatable, round-trip migrations between the tagging site in the Florida Keys and northern points in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. Conversely, others remained in the Florida Keys year-round. Network analysis coupled with community detection algorithms revealed that individual great hammerheads displayed oceanic basin affinity, favouring migration to either the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. Great hammerheads that remained in the Florida Keys shifted their habitat use seasonally from inshore channels (spring and summer) to offshore artificial reefs and the natural reef tract (summer through winter). These shifts may be driven by prey availability, as core use areas often corresponded to known locations of seasonal spawning aggregations for reef fish. These data fill an important knowledge gap for great hammerhead migratory patterns that can improve spatial management strategies for this historically overexploited species. We discuss the importance of drawing upon data from multiple tagging locations for highly mobile species management, particularly in the designation of essential fish habitat.","[Casselberry, Grace A.; Griffin, Lucas P.; Finn, John T.; Dello Russo, Joseph; Filous, Alex; Morley, Danielle; Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA USA; [Griffin, Lucas P.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, Tampa, FL USA; [Brownscombe, Jacob W.; Holder, Peter E.; Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Dello Russo, Joseph] Univ Maine, Sch Marine Sci, Orono, ME USA; [Daughtry, Ben] Florida Keys Aquarium Encounters, Marathon, FL USA; [Kneebone, Jeff] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA USA; [Morley, Danielle] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, South Florida Reg Lab, Marathon, FL USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Gainesville, FL USA; [Anderson, Brooke N.; Sulikowski, James] Oregon State Univ, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Newport, OR USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Carleton University; University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Oregon State University,"Casselberry, GA (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",gcasselberry@umass.edu,"Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Lowerre-Barbieri, Sue/JOZ-3798-2023","Griffin, Lucas/0000-0002-8560-0683; Casselberry, Grace/0000-0002-7572-7584",Office of National Marine Sanctuaries [OCE-2006293]; Tarpon Trust - National Science Foundation; Krystan Wilkinson (Sarasota Dolphin Research Program),Office of National Marine Sanctuaries; Tarpon Trust - National Science Foundation; Krystan Wilkinson (Sarasota Dolphin Research Program),"Broad-scale acoustic telemetry papers like this one would not be possible without the dedicated work of the researchers who maintain acoustic telemetry arrays and data-sharing networks.

However, limited comparisons have been made between more common broad-scale acoustic data and fine-scale positioning data and it is unknown whether differences exist in ecological inferences gained or lost between using either array configuration over the other. Broad-scale movement and habitat use information was collected for eight Yellowtail Snapper Ocyurus chrysurus tagged within an array of 78 stationary acoustic receivers deployed in Buck Island Reef National Monument, a marine protected area located northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. An additional 25 receivers were nested within the larger array as a VEMCO Positioning System and were used to assess fine-scale habitat use for five of the eight tagged fish. Broad-scale results inferred from network analysis revealed that all individuals had core use receivers along the shallow shelf break situated west of Buck Island, preferring an area that was coarsely characterized by sand and seagrass benthic habitats. Fine-scale results using Euclidean distance analysis (EDA) suggested fish positions occurred randomly or independent of benthic habitat type. Further exploration of positioning data suggested that there were two contingents or groups of fish displaying unique movement patterns within the fine-scale positioning array. Individuality in space and habitat use was thus masked when using an EDA approach at the study population level, as it was also missed during broad-scale analyses. Discrepancies between broad- and fine-scale habitat inferences suggest that positioning systems are necessary for interpreting habitat use in complex coral reef ecosystems. Nested positioning systems appear to add substantial information that is not obtainable using broad-scale data alone, and caution is necessary in inferring habitat use when only coarse-scale location data are available.","[Novak, Ashleigh J.; Becker, Sarah L.; Finn, John T.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI 00820 USA; [Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Novak, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",novakjashleigh@gmail.com,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011","NPS, Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14]; University of Massachusetts-Amherst","NPS, Puerto Rico Sea Grant; University of Massachusetts-Amherst","We thank Tessa Code, Jeff Gay, Rich Berey, and many additional volunteers and NPS employees for field assistance and array maintenance.

Among MPAs, a large percentage has been created with the implicit goal of protecting shark populations, including 17 shark sanctuaries which fully protect sharks throughout their jurisdiction. The Commonwealth of the Bahamas represents a long-term MPA for sharks, following the banning of commercial longlining in 1993 and subsequent designation as a shark sanctuary in 2011. Little is known, however, about the longterm behavior and space use of sharks within this protected area, particularly among reef-associated sharks for which the sanctuary presumably offers the most benefit. We used acoustic telemetry to advance our understanding of the ecology of such sharks, namely Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier), over two discrete islands (New Providence and Great Exuma) varying in human activity level, over 2 years. We evaluated which factors influenced the likelihood of detection of individuals, analyzed patterns of movement and occurrence, and identified variability in habitat selection among species and regions, using a dataset of 23 Caribbean reef sharks and 15 tiger sharks which were passively monitored in two arrays with a combined total of 13 acoustic receivers. Caribbean reef sharks had lower detection probabilities than tiger sharks, and exhibited relatively low habitat connectivity and high residency, while tiger sharks demonstrated wider roaming behavior across much greater space. Tiger sharks were associated with shallow seagrass habitats where available, but frequently transited between and connected different habitat types. Our data support the notion that large MPAs afford greater degrees of protection for highly resident species such as Caribbean reef sharks, shark, acoustic telemetry, marine protected area, MPA, seagrass, coral reef, Bahamas, Caribbean","[Gallagher, Austin J.; Shipley, Oliver N.; Kattan, Sami; Shea, Brendan D.] Waves, Herndon, VA 20172 USA; [Shipley, Oliver N.; Frisk, Michael G.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Bergmann, Maurits P.

The yellowmouth barracuda Sphyraena viridensis and the almaco jack Seriola rivoliana are the 2 most abundant bentho-pelagic reef predators in the Azores archipelago (central North Atlantic). They aggregate at shallow offshore seamounts, and largely share diet preferences, but very little is known about how habitat and resources are shared by these predators intra- and inter-specifically. Here we use long-term (over 3 yr) passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the patterns of activity, space use and associative behaviour at an isolated, small shallow seamount. By quantifying fine-scale spatiotemporal overlaps and performing null model randomization tests, we found evidence of non-random associations, mostly between conspecifics of both species, as well as shifts in diel and seasonal patterns of space occupancy. Both species were detected more often during spring, and appear to be more active during daytime, suggesting the absence of fine-scale temporal habitat partitioning. Additionally, we found evidence of size-dependent spatial behaviour in almaco jack, with similarly sized individuals co-occurring more often and larger specimens being more infrequently detected. This study quantitatively assesses individual associations using solely presence-absence data collected through passive acoustic telemetry, showing the potential of this approach in a broader application to a significant number of past and ongoing studies, even if many were not originally designed to study this important aspect of fish ecology.","[Gandra, Miguel] Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res IMAR, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge] Univ Azores, OKEANOS UAc, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve; Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores,"Gandra, M (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Ctr Marine Sci CCMAR, Campus Gambelas, P-8005139 Faro, Portugal.",m3gandra@gmail.com,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Gandra, Miguel/0000-0003-1506-5141","project MARMACII [INTERREG/05/MAC/4.2/A4]; project SEAMOV [PTDC/MAR/1082 32/2008]; project MoniZEC [DRCT/0281M2.1.2/I/018/2011]; FCT/MCTES; DRCT Reequipamento programs; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT) [UID/MAR/04292/2013, IF/01640/2015, SFRH/BPD/66532/2009]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/66532/2009] Funding Source: FCT",project MARMACII; project SEAMOV; project MoniZEC; FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); DRCT Reequipamento programs; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We thank T.

However, we lack the long-term high-resolution data needed to understand parrotfish space-use patterns over time. We examine long-term space-use dynamics in parrotfish (median duration: 359 days) by tracking 23 terminal-males of three species along a coral reef in the Northern Red Sea Gulf of Aqaba. We used acoustic telemetry to track horizontal movement along the reef, depth, and activity (through tri-axial accelerometers), and quantify the effect of environmental factors such as water temperature and algal abundance on long-term patterns. We found that in the species examined, nearly all individuals maintained a highly consistent spatial pattern throughout the study duration, in which they repeatedly moved along a distinct route between nighttime sleeping areas and spatially constrained daytime areas. Individual patterns were surprisingly conserved over time, despite seasonal changes and variation in resource abundance. Individuals differed considerably in their daily travel distance, with some traveling up to 2000 m along the reef, while others moved only between deep and shallow areas. Activity levels consistently peaked around mid-day, regardless of the location of their daytime areas, which behavioral surveys confirm are associated with feeding activities. We also detected peaks in activity during early mornings when surveys detect that parrotfish interacted in large aggregates (typically 30-60 individuals). Our findings indicate that space-use patterns vary among individuals but are extremely conservative within individuals over long time periods. This in turn may have important consequences to the health of reefs, as individual parrotfish may be less likely to alter foraging patterns as conditions change. Furthermore, the high fidelity to limited sleeping and daytime areas may be a source of concern, as local small-scale disturbances may strongly disrupt individual space-use patterns.","[Pickholtz, Renanel; Zamsky, Revital; Gavriel, Tal; Belmaker, Jonathan] Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Pickholtz, Renanel; Kiflawi, Moshe; Kahan, Inbal] Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, IL-88103 Elat, Israel; [Kiflawi, Moshe] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Life Sci, POB 653, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Crossin, Glenn T.] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Evolutionary Physiol & Anim Ecol Lab, Halifax, NS B3H 1J8, Canada; [Belmaker, Jonathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Steinhart Museum Nat Hist, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University; Ben-Gurion University of the Negev; Dalhousie University; Tel Aviv University,"Pickholtz, R (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, George S Wise Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.;Pickholtz, R (corresponding author), Interuniv Inst Marine Sci Eilat, IL-88103 Elat, Israel.",renanel.pickholtz@gmail.com,"KIFLAWI, MOSHE/AAH-7991-2021; Belmaker, Jonathan/I-1004-2019","Pickholtz, Renanel/0000-0001-7319-991X",Schulich Ocean Studies Center Initiative at Dalhousie University (Canada); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant,Schulich Ocean Studies Center Initiative at Dalhousie University (Canada); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"This work was supported by the Schulich Ocean Studies Center Initiative at Dalhousie University (Canada), a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant.",,111,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0722-4028,1432-0975,,CORAL REEFS,Coral Reefs,AUG,2022,41,4,,,,,1059,1073,,10.1007/s00338-022-02258-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00338-022-02258-3,,APR 2022,15,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine & Freshwater Biology,3M0IK,,,,,2025-05-02,WOS:000796016900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Temporal partitioning of resources can reduce intra-specific competition, but this has seldom been examined in predators in marine ecosystems. Here, we used 8 years of acoustic telemetry data from 27 receivers deployed in a large coastal embayment to examine the temporal residency of 51 Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni), during their breeding season. We found that the residency lengths of male and female Port Jackson sharks on breeding reefs differed throughout the breeding season, with males showing longer residency at the start of the season and females showing longer residency at the end of the season. Port Jackson sharks also showed a 24-h or diel periodicity in their detection patterns. Although the majority of individuals were nocturnal, a small proportion of sharks was detected more frequently during the day, possibly to reduce competition for resources. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the sex ratio nor the size of diurnal and nocturnal individuals. This study provides long-term insight into the temporal residency patterns of mesopredatory sharks at a breeding site and, more broadly, our results highlight the importance of studying temporal variation at the individual level in movement ecology studies.","[Bass, Nathan Charles; Day, Joanna; Brown, Culum] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Day, Joanna] Taronga Conservat Soc Australia, Taronga Inst Sci & Learning, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia; [Guttridge, Tristan L.] Saving Blue, Cooper City, FL 33328 USA; [Knott, Nathan A.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries Res, 4 Woollamia Rd, Huskisson, NSW 2540, Australia",Macquarie University; Taronga Conservation Society Australia; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Bass, NC (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",nathancbass@mail.com,"Knott, Nathan/AAA-8888-2019; Brown, Culum/S-9826-2017","Bass, Nathan/0000-0002-5815-1392; Brown, Culum/0000-0002-0210-1820; Knott, Nathan/0000-0002-7873-0412",,,,,71,9,10,0,7,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

However, little is known about juvenile stingray movement patterns and habitat use in coral reefs. This study used active acoustic telemetry to determine fine-scale diel movement patterns and habitat use of juvenile cowtail stingrays (Pastinachus ater) in a coral reef flat environment. Seven cowtail stingrays (4 males and 3 females) were manually tracked between April and December 2016. Each individual was tracked over 2 days, generating a total of 14 active tracks ranging from 4.91 to 9 h. Specimens moved at an average speed of 2.44 m min(-1) +/- 0.87 SE, with minimum distances travelled ranging from 546 to 1446 m. Tracking data showed that juvenile cowtail stingrays move in response to tidal cycles, moving faster and in straighter pathways during incoming and outgoing tides. Juvenile cowtail stingrays also showed a strong affinity to sand flat areas and mangrove edge areas. These areas provide food resources and potential refuges for juvenile rays to avoid predators. Coral reef flats were identified as secondary refuge for juveniles during the lowest tides. Future research is necessary to fully unveil the major drivers of juvenile cowtail stingray seasonal and ontogenetic movement patterns and habitat use within coral reef flat environments. This information is important to establish a full understanding of juvenile cowtail stingray ecology, but could also improve management and conservation policies.","[Martins, A. P. B.; Bierwagen, S.

We used manual acoustic telemetry coupled with global positioning technology to track the detailed spatially explicit daily movements (24 h) of multiple individuals of two common Caribbean fish species, Haemulon sciurus (bluestriped grunt) and Lutjanus apodus (schoolmaster snapper). Movement pathways and day and night activity spaces were mapped and quantified in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Directional sun-synchronous migrations occurred close to astronomical sunset and sunrise. Site fidelity within day and night activity spaces was high. Nine of twelve individuals exhibited overlap of day and night activity spaces and three fish (L. apodus) exhibited complete spatial segregation. Night activity spaces (H. sciurus: 11,309 +/- 3,548 m(2); L. apodus: 9,950 +/- 3,120 m(2)) were significantly larger than day activity spaces (H. sciurus: 2,778 +/- 1,979 m(2); L. apodus: 1,291 +/- 636 m(2)). The distance between sequential position fixes (step lengths) was significantly greater at night than day, indicative of nocturnal foraging and day resting behavior. Integrating acoustic telemetry, GIS techniques and spatial statistics to study fish movement behavior revealed both individual variability and some broader generality in movement paths and activity spaces suggestive of complex underlying behavioral mechanisms influencing diel movements.","[Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Pittman, Simon J.] NOAA NOS NCCOS CCMA, Biogeog Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Brown, Kerry A.] Kingston Univ London, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 1LQ, Surrey, England",University of the Virgin Islands; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Kingston University,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,"Brown, Kerry/U-5082-2019","Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970; BROWN, KERRY/0000-0002-6342-8966",NOAA; University of the Virgin Islands,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); University of the Virgin Islands,"This research was supported by a NOAA cooperative agreement with the University of the Virgin Islands.

We report similar home range (HR) for both species, with adult males displaying greater HR than females and juveniles. An increased mobility of adult males was observed during the austral summer for the silvertip shark, and the austral winter for the grey reef shark, corresponding to putative mating seasons. Our study brings new insight on the ecology of the silvertip shark and provides essential material to inform targeted conservation measures.","[Bonnin, Lucas; Boussarie, Germain; Vigliola, Laurent] Univ New Caledonia, Univ La Reunion, Inst Rech Dev IRD, UMR ENTROPIE,IRD,CNRS,Ifremer, 101 Promenade Roger Laroque, F-98848 Noumea, New Caledonia, France; [Kiszka, Jeremy J.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Robbins, William] Wildlife Marine, Perth, WA 6020, Australia; [Robbins, William] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Perth, WA, Australia",University of La Reunion; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ifremer; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Bonnin, L (corresponding author), Univ New Caledonia, Univ La Reunion, Inst Rech Dev IRD, UMR ENTROPIE,IRD,CNRS,Ifremer, 101 Promenade Roger Laroque, F-98848 Noumea, New Caledonia, France.",lucasbonnin@hotmail.fr,"Kiszka, Jeremy/AAH-2588-2020; Vigliola, Laurent/J-7107-2016","Boussarie, Germain/0000-0002-0809-1555; Vigliola, Laurent/0000-0003-4715-7470; Bonnin, Lucas/0000-0002-5674-1911",Total Foundation; Pew Charitable Trusts; Government of New Caledonia,Total Foundation(Total SA); Pew Charitable Trusts; Government of New Caledonia,"We thank the crew of the research vessel Amborella (Government of New Caledonia).

Understanding habitat preferences of hawksbills at different life stages is necessary to create effective local and regional conservation strategies. We studied habitat use and the diet of juvenile hawksbill sea turtles at Punta Coyote, a rocky. reef located along the Nicoya Peninsula on the north Pacific coast of Costa Rica, along the northern boundary of the Caletas-Ario National Wildlife Refuge. We tracked 12 juvenile hawksbills (36-69-cm curved carapace length) with acoustic transmitters to study their habitat use. Turtles were on the rocky reef more frequently than the sandy bottoms (chi(2)(1) = 29.90, p = 0.00). The 95% fixed kernel density home range analysis revealed high-intensity use of the rocky reef, where hawksbills mainly dove in shallow waters (7.6 +/- 3.3 m). Less than 5% of the 95% home range area overlapped with the Caletas-Ario National Wildlife Refuge. Hawksbills fed mainly on 2 invertebrate species regardless of season: a sponge (Geodia sp.) (mean volume = 67%) and a tunicate (Rhopalaea birkelandi) (mean volume = 51%). Our surveys along the Nicoya Peninsula suggested that use of rocky reefs by juvenile hawksbill turtles was common. To protect juvenile hawksbills in the study area, we recommend that this site be granted official protection status as part of the Caletas-Ario National Wildlife Refuge. We also suggest studying other discrete rocky reefs along the Nicoya Peninsula to determine critical habitats for the hawksbill turtle to improve conservation and management policy.","[Carrion-Cortez, Javier; Riosmena-Rodriguez, Rafael] Univ Autonoma Baja Calif Sur, Dept Biol Marina, Programa Invest Bot Marina, La Paz 23080, Mexico; [Canales-Cerro, Carlos] Univ Andres Bello, Fac Ecol & Recursos Nat, Dept Biol Marina, Santiago, Chile; [Arauz, Randall] Asociac Programa Restaurac Tortugas Marinas, San Jose, Costa Rica",Universidad Autonoma de Baja California; Universidad Andres Bello,"Carrión-Cortez, J (corresponding author), Fdn Charles Darwin, Dept Biol Marina, Santa Cruz, Galapagos, Ecuador.",tavaruava@hotmail.com; rarauz@pretoma.org; riosmena@uabcs.mx,"Canales-Cerro, Carlos/P-1886-2019",,"Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation (RSG); Programa de Restauracion de Tortugas Marinas (PRETOMA, Costa Rica); Casa Tortuga; BBC Wildlife Fund-Whitley Fund for Nature, Conservation International; Idea Wild","Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation (RSG); Programa de Restauracion de Tortugas Marinas (PRETOMA, Costa Rica); Casa Tortuga; BBC Wildlife Fund-Whitley Fund for Nature, Conservation International; Idea Wild","Financial support was provided by the Rufford Small Grants for Nature Conservation (RSG), the Programa de Restauracion de Tortugas Marinas (PRETOMA, Costa Rica), Casa Tortuga, the BBC Wildlife Fund-Whitley Fund for Nature, Conservation International, and Idea Wild.

We performed an acoustic tagging study implemented on Denis Island in the Seychelles to assess the area of influence of the heavily targeted shoemaker spinefoot, Siganus sutor. We investigated whether this species acts as a mobile link between coral patches and seagrass meadows, and whether their movements differed between day and night. The study incorporated an array of 22 acoustic stations deployed within dense coral patches, seagrass meadows and mixed habitats of both seagrass and coral. Fifteen S. sutor carrying internal acoustic tags were monitored from November 2016 until May 2017. Detection patterns revealed them to be diurnal herbivores, with only rare nocturnal movements. Home-range estimates showed that individuals differed in their spatial range extents and habitats used, covering ~15% of the total shallow subtidal coastline of the island. However, they displayed very small daily movements (<200 m), concentrated mainly around sites within mixed coral and seagrass habitats. An optimal number of detections was recorded when the coral to seagrass area ratio was approximately 1.6:1. This ratio was confirmed through statistical prediction modelling. Identification of such links of commercially important species between networked habitats may help authorities consider incorporating seagrass meadows of the Seychelles into management discussions, which are currently lacking.","[Ebrahim, Ameer; Mumby, Peter J.; Tibbetts, Ian R.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Ebrahim, Ameer; Bijoux, Jude P.] Seychelles Fishing Author, Mahe, Seychelles",University of Queensland,"Ebrahim, A (corresponding author), POB 104, Mahe, Seychelles.;Ebrahim, A (corresponding author), La Louise, Mahe, Seychelles.",ameer.ebrahim@uqconnect.edu.au,"Tibbetts, Ian/K-6191-2013; Ebrahim, Ameer/AAX-5759-2021; Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010","Ebrahim, Ameer/0000-0002-4240-6100",,,,,54,4,4,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

This perception is challenged here through a combined analysis of multi-annual commercial landings, underwater visual census and telemetry data from acoustically tagged fish to investigate the long-term movement patterns and residency (up to 4 years) in a seamount marine reserve. Although the landing patterns suggested a strong seasonal variation in abundance, the visual census and the telemetry experiment results were consistent with year-round residency in the Azores. Barracudas occurred consistently in underwater census throughout the year, and most tagged fish were almost continuously detected at the seamounts for up to four consecutive years. Detection probability did, however, decrease over time and showed seasonal variability as tagged fish were less mobile with longer absences during summer and fall.

Seasonal migrations of Mutton Snapper Lutjanus analis between protected nearshore areas and spawning grounds on Riley's Hump in Dry Tortugas, Florida, were assessed from 2008 to 2012 by acoustic telemetry. Individual fish showed synchronized reproductive migrations (up to 5 trips fish(-1) yr(-1)) from resident habitats to spawning grounds swimming at an estimated 63 +/- 18 cm s(-1) (mean +/- SD) over minimum linear distances up to 35.2 km. Migrations occurred from April to August, corresponding with the lunar cycle and an increase in water temperature from 25 to 30 degrees C. Fish arrived on spawning grounds on the full moon and stayed for 7 +/- 2 d (mean +/- SD). Observations of multiple spawning events made one to five days after the full moon in the late afternoon confirm these movements as spawning migrations. Functional migration areas (109.59 +/- 61.01 km(2) ; mean +/- SD), which included estimates of staging/courtship/spawning area (4.51 +/- 1.84 km(2) [mean +/- SD]) and home site area (2.50 +/- 1.31 km(2) [mean +/- SD]), were combined to estimate the minimum catchment area of the population studied (291.3 km(2)). Although this study focuses on movements and habitat use of a single fish species in the Tortugas, the results are relevant to the design of marine reserve networks intended to protect and manage fishes that undergo transient spawning migrations in other locations as well.","[Feeley, Michael W.; Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro; Barbera, Paul; Hunt, John] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA; [Switzer, Ted] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Burton, Michael] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, 101 Pivers Isl Rd, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Feeley, Michael W.] Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Network, 18001 Old Cutler Rd,Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA",Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Feeley, MW (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 2796 Overseas Hwy Suite 119, Marathon, FL 33050 USA.;Feeley, MW (corresponding author), Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Network, 18001 Old Cutler Rd,Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA.",michael_feeley@nps.gov; danielle.morley@myfwc.com; alejandro.acosta@myfwc.com; paul.barbera@myfwc.com; john.hunt@myfwc.com; ted.switzer@myfwc.com; michael.burton@noaa.gov,"Burton, Michael/ABE-4500-2020","Morley, Danielle/0000-0001-7286-0606","USGS State Partnership Program [007-0083-023, 08ERAG0007]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program [MOA-2001-683, 004/7477 (1007-2009), (006)/7910, MOA-2010-026/8081]; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (NOS) [MOA-2010-026/8081]; Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida [DFO 0809-03]; National Park Service [DRTO-2008-SCI-0003, DRTO-2010-SCI-0006]; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary [FKNMS-2008-015, FKNMS-2013-040]",USGS State Partnership Program; NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (NOS); Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida; National Park Service; Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary,"This research was supported by the USGS State Partnership Program (Project Number: 007-0083-023 and Grant # 08ERAG0007), NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (MOA-2001-683 Amendment No. 004/7477 (1007-2009), (Amendment No.006)/7910; NOS Agreement No. MOA-2010-026/8081), and Discover Florida's Ocean Tag Grant (DFO 0809-03) through the Wildlife Foundation of Florida and conducted under scientific research permits issued by the National Park Service (DRTO-2008-SCI-0003, DRTO-2010-SCI-0006) and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS-2008-015, FKNMS-2013-040).

To better understand spatial and temporal movement patterns and help determine the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve (Buck Island Reef National Monument, BIRNM), 55 queen triggerfish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked for 434.6 +/- 27.3 d (mean SE) within a large acoustic array in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Queen triggerfish displayed high site fidelity within the reserve during non-spawning months. Home range sizes, as measured by 95 % minimum convex polygons and kernel utilization distributions, averaged 2.44 t 0.30 and 3.34 +/- 0.17 km(2), respectively. High site fidelity was interrupted briefly during full moons from November to March (2015-2017), when 22 % of the tagged population (n = 12) undertook repeated migrations to a nesting area located approximately 12 km from BIRNM. During the same-season spawning periods, 5 other fish were exclusively detected at a receiver station within the reserve, indicating a possible local nesting area and resident (non-migratory) contingent of queen triggerfish. The high site fidelity of queen triggerfish during non-spawning months coupled with the discovery of a resident spawning population highlights the importance of BIRNM as a potential refuge from local fishing pressures. This study provides improved understanding of queen triggerfish movement ecology, an extremely valuable asset for the development of spatial management strategies throughout their range.","[Bryan, David R.; Ault, Jerald S.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Bryan, David R.] Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Feeley, Michael W.] Natl Pk Serv, South Florida Caribbean Inventory & Monitoring Ne, 18001 Old Cutler Rd Suite 419, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Pollock, Clayton] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Natl Pk, 2100 Church St 100, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA",University of Miami; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; University of the Virgin Islands; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Bryan, DR (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.;Bryan, DR (corresponding author), Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",david.bryan@noaa.gov,"Ault, Jerald/A-5241-2008","Ault, Jerald/0000-0001-9657-8007; Bryan, David/0000-0002-3846-1553",NPS [PMIS 141633]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (MARFIN) [NA13NMF4330167]; Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (National Science Foundation) [1355437]; Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1355437] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NPS; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (MARFIN)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (National Science Foundation); Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),"National Park Service (NPS) staff Tessa Code and Jeff Gay were a tremendous help with in situ tagging operations and led the colossal task of downloading and maintaining the acoustic array.

An alternative is to protect essential habitats, such as spawning grounds, especially if these are stable over time. We studied the movements and habitat use patterns of white trevally Pseudocaranx dentex (Carangidae), a commercially important species, to assist in the design of marine reserves. Diel, seasonal and inter-annual movements of trevally were studied using active acoustic tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-release in the Faial Channel, Azores Islands. White trevally were captured at inshore and offshore reefs. Inshore trevally moved daily alongshore, using large activity spaces, while the short-term movements of offshore trevally were restricted to the reef summits. During the summer spawning season, both groups displayed frequent migrations of up to several kilometres, but inshore fish remained inshore, whereas offshore reef fish expanded their range to include visits to inshore sites. This behaviour eventually resulted in low long-term residence within the study area, especially that of inshore fish. During the spawning season, one inshore site was visited by most of the fish. However, instead of gathering in large aggregations at a single location, it appears that the trevally adopted a multiple-site visiting behaviour, which may increase mating opportunities through mixing between inshore and offshore fish that are otherwise segregated for most of the year. Protection of spawning biomass and sites for this species seems potentially feasible, but this would require protecting a suite of sites per island. Furthermore, because fish would not be fully protected under this scenario, we argue that such spatial management measures need to be accompanied by conventional fishing-effort control measures applied to all local populations.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii System,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Cais De Santa Cruz, Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589","FCT/MCTES [SFRH/BD/11132/2002, SFRH/ BD/12788/2003]; Associated Laboratory ISR; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BD/12788/2003, SFRH/BD/11132/2002] Funding Source: FCT",FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Associated Laboratory ISR; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We sincerely thank A.

We used visual surveys and acoustic telemetry to investigate density and movement of 2 Brazilian endemic and highly targeted reef fish species inside and outside a coral reef NTZ, and subsequently inferred the effectiveness of the NTZ for protecting these species. To do so, visual surveys were performed on protected and unprotected reefs between 2016 and 2017. Moreover, 20 gray parrotfish Sparisoma axillare and 9 Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored from December 2016 to October 2017. For both species, fish densities were significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost. The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs, predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were small (0.10 to 0.45 km(2)), and both species presented spatially segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88% for S. axillare and 95% for L. alexandrei. The results showed that small NTZs that are important to part of the life cycle of a target species are an effective measure to conserve reef fish populations, and also highlight the importance of fisheries management outside NTZs.","[Lippi, Daniel Lino; Bertoldi Gaspar, Ana Lidia; Maida, Mauro; Ferreira, Beatrice Padovani] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil; [Coxey, Mariana Sofia] ISPA Inst Univ, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, P-1149041 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rooker, Jay R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Rooker, Jay R.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecol & Conservat Biol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Rezende, Sergio Magalhaes] Natl Ctr Res & Conservat Marine Biodivers Northea, BR-55578000 Tamandare, Brazil; [Dance, Michael A.] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Universidade Federal de Pernambuco; Instituto Superior Psicologia Aplicada (ISPA); Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University,"Lippi, DL (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Dept Oceanog, BR-50740550 Recife, PE, Brazil.",daniel_lippi@hotmail.com,"Ferreira, Beatrice/A-5786-2013; Rooker, Jay/M-3197-2013","Gaspar, Ana Lidia Bertoldi/0000-0002-8030-9758; Lippi, Daniel/0000-0003-0272-9420; Rooker, Jay/0000-0002-5934-7688","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuc [441632/2016-5]; Petrobras S.A.-Programa Petrobras Ambiental; CNPQ [140950/2016-8, 151219/2021-4, PVE 155131/2016-8, 309216/2018-4]; GEFMAR/DIBIO/ICMBio; [PVE 401594/2014-9]","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuc(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)Fundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF)); Petrobras S.A.-Programa Petrobras Ambiental(Petrobras); CNPQ(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); GEFMAR/DIBIO/ICMBio;","This work was funded by Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq) through financing ILTER site 18 (PELD Tamandare Sustentavel): Spatial and temporal dynamics of marine ecosystems: connectivity, resilience and sustainable use in southern Pernambuco (441632/2016-5), and the visiting scholar program (PVE 401594/2014-9).

Because most of the past telemetric studies on this ecologically and commercially important species were short in duration and did not cover the reproductive season, we set out to use longer-term passive acoustic telemetry to test this hypothesis. We found that white seabream expands its home range and increases the frequency of forays during the reproductive season, but found no obvious signs of spawning aggregations. Our results thus provide evidence for short-range behavioral shifts in fish space use related to reproductive activity, and support the notion that small MPAs may be effective in managing reef fish populations by effectively protecting their spawning biomass.

Temporal patterns and fish position were determined using a fixed-receiver array located in a marine protected area (MPA) in Palma Bay (Balearic Islands). Fish position as centre of activity (COA, the centre of the area the fish uses during a specific time) and space utilisation preferences could be described due to a receiver array design with a high range detection overlap (more densely distributed near the COA). There were significantly more detections per time unit during the day, which was interpreted as increased activity possibly related to feeding habits and social behaviour. S. cabrilla spent 95% of its time in an average area of 0.77 +/- 0.17 km(2), with a core area (50% of the time) of 0.10 +/- 0.29 km(2). The home range size was not related to fish size or diel pattern (i.e. the size of the daytime home range was not significantly different from the night range). The linearity index and the index of reuse (proxies of site fidelity) also demonstrated that this species has high site fidelity, which suggests that it is sedentary with a limited adult dispersal capacity. Two main habitats were observed in the study area, and S. cabrilla spent on average much less time in seagrass meadows (Posidonia oceanica beds) compared to soft, gravel and detritus bottoms. A relatively small MPA would be a useful management tool for establishing sustainable exploitation levels of this species.","[Alos, Josep; March, David; Palmer, Miquel; Morales-Nin, Beatriz] CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain; [Grau, Amalia] Lab Invest Marines & Aquicultura LIMIA, Port Dandratx 07157, Illes Baleares, Spain",University of Barcelona; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Alós, J (corresponding author), CSIC UIB, IMEDEA, Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, C Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Illes Balears, Spain.",pep.alos@uib.es,"Palmer, Miquel/E-3561-2013; March, David/G-6489-2014","Miquel, Palmer/0000-0002-7875-3673; Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539; March, David/0000-0002-6118-761X; Grau, Amalia/0000-0002-6461-6985; Morales-Nin, Beatriz/0000-0002-7264-0918","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [CGL2008-00958]; FPI, MICINN","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government); FPI, MICINN(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)","We thank the staff of the Direccio General de Pesca (Govern de les Illes Balears) and the researchers who helped with the experimental fishing and logistic procedures, especially A.

Fine-scale acoustic telemetry tracking was used to ascertain the home range and habitat utilization of S. pulcher. Sixteen adult S. pulcher (26-38 cm SL) were surgically fitted with small acoustic transmitters and manually tracked for up to 144 h during multiple, 24-h periods between March 2001 and August 2002 within the Catalina Marine Science Center Marine Life Reserve (33 degrees 26'N; 118 degrees 29'W). A geographic information system was used to calculate home range sizes (95% kernel utilization distributions) and habitat use. Tracking of the first five fish over 24 h confirmed that S. pulcher were strictly diurnal, so the remaining 11 fish were tracked from 1 h before sunrise to 1 h after sunset. Home ranges varied greatly, from 938 to 82,070 m(2), with a mean (+/- SD) of 15,134 +/- 26,007 m(2). Variability in home range sizes among fish was attributed to differences in habitat shape (embayment vs. contiguous coastline) and to natural habitat boundaries (deep, sandy expanses) in adjacent areas within the reserve. There was a significant relationship between fish length and proportion of time spent in different habitats (sand vs. reef). S. pulcher were found within rocky-reef areas 54% of the time, and, within these areas, a greater percentage of daytime was spent in high-relief areas. Based on the relatively small size and persistence of home ranges of adult S. pulcher, no-take reserves, if they contain appropriate habitat, would provide adequate protection for their stocks.","Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",dtopping13@hotmail.com,,,,,,,43,113,153,0,38,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The bronze whaler (Carcharhinus brachyurus) is a large-bodied, slow-growing shark species that is widely distributed throughout temperate Australian waters. Currently, habitat use, spatio-temporal presence and fine-scale movement information is unknown for Southern Australian waters. This study investigated the spatio-temporal patterns of occurrence, habitat use, and residency of bronze whalers in Gulf St. Vincent, South Australia. Forty-seven predominately small juvenile bronze whalers (83% of tagged sharks<150cm TL) were tagged with acoustic transmitters from 2009 to 2014 and monitored for periods of up to 55months (range 516-1634days; mean +/- standard error 825 +/- 47). The seasonal presence of bronze whalers peaked in spring-early autumn (September-April). Site fidelity was high, with 77% of tagged sharks detected over multiple years and 36% detected over 3years. Low estimates of mean residency index (R-i=0.05 +/- 0.01) indicated that time spent within the array was limited. Shark occurrence was driven by a combination of factors, which included water temperature, season, moon illumination, and wind speed. Manly-Chesson's Electivity Index showed bronze whalers exhibited the highest affinity to seagrass (Posidonia spp.), suggesting that this habitat plays an important role in the early life history stages. The slow growth and low productivity of bronze whalers combined with its predictable nearshore occurrence result in this species having an increased susceptibility to anthropogenic threats, which highlights the need for continued monitoring and vulnerability assessments.","[Drew, Michael; Rogers, Paul] South Australia Res & Dev Inst Aquat Sci, Finfish Subprogram, Adelaide, SA 5024, Australia; [Drew, Michael; Lloyd, Matthew; Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Biol Sci, Southern Shark Ecol Grp, Adelaide, SA 5043, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Drew, M (corresponding author), South Australia Res & Dev Inst Aquat Sci, Finfish Subprogram, Adelaide, SA 5024, Australia.;Drew, M (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Biol Sci, Southern Shark Ecol Grp, Adelaide, SA 5043, Australia.",michael.drew@sa.gov.au,,"Huveneers, Charlie/0000-0001-8937-1358; Drew, Michael/0000-0002-5109-7792",Australian Postgraduate Award; Adelaide & Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board; Neiser Foundation; Nature Foundation of South Australia Inc; Tracking Research for Animal Conservation Society (TRACS); Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy; Super Science Initiative,"Australian Postgraduate Award(Australian Government); Adelaide & Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board; Neiser Foundation; Nature Foundation of South Australia Inc; Tracking Research for Animal Conservation Society (TRACS); Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Super Science Initiative","This project was jointly funded by the Australian Postgraduate Award to MD, the Adelaide & Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board, the Neiser Foundation, the Nature Foundation of South Australia Inc, and the Tracking Research for Animal Conservation Society (TRACS).

We tagged 355 green sturgeon with acoustic transmitters on their spawning grounds and in known nonspawning aggregation sites and examined their movement among these sites and other potentially important locations using automated data-logging hydrophones. We found that green sturgeon inhabit a number of estuarine and coastal sites over the summer, including the Columbia River estuary, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor, and the estuaries of certain smaller rivers in Oregon, especially the Umpqua River estuary. Green sturgeon from different natal rivers exhibited different patterns of habitat use; most notably, San Francisco Bay was used only by Sacramento River fish, while the Umpqua River estuary was used mostly by fish from the Klamath and Rogue rivers. Earlier work, based on analysis of microsatellite markers, suggested that the Columbia River mixed stock was mainly composed of fish from the Sacramento River, but our results indicate that fish from the Rogue and Klamath River populations frequently use the Columbia River as well. We also found evidence for the existence of migratory contingents within spawning populations. Our findings have significant implications for the management of the threatened Sacramento River population of green sturgeon, which migrates to inland waters outside of California where anthropogenic impacts, including fisheries bycatch and water pollution, may be a concern. Our results also illustrate the utility of acoustic tracking to elucidate the migratory behavior of animals that are otherwise difficult to observe.","[Lindley, Steven T.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, SW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Erickson, Daniel L.] Bronx Zoo, Marine Program, Wildlife Conservat Soc, Bronx, NY 10460 USA; [Moser, Mary L.; Williams, Greg] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, NW Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Langness, Olaf P.] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Vancouver, WA 98661 USA; [McCovey, Barry W., Jr.; Belchik, Michael] Yurok Tribal Fisheries Program, Weitchpec, CA 95546 USA; [Vogel, Dave] Nat Resource Scientists Inc, Red Bluff, CA 96080 USA; [Pinnix, William] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Arcata, CA 95521 USA; [Kelly, John T.; Heublein, Joseph C.; Klimley, A.

The Ningaloo Reef Marine Park comprises an area of 4,566 km(2) of which 34% is protected from fishing by 18 no-take sanctuary zones ranging in size from 0.08-44.8 km(2). To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5 +/- 0.5 km(2) compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km(2). Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending similar to 80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km(2) array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements. This study indicates that despite exhibiting stable and small home ranges over periods of one to two years, more than half the population of spangled emperor move at scales greater than average sanctuary size within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park.","[Pillans, Richard D.; Babcock, Russel C.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Downie, Ryan; Patterson, Toby A.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Bearham, Douglas; Thomson, Damian P.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Perth, WA, Australia; [Boomer, Andrew] SIMS, IMOS Anim Tagging & Monitoring, Mosman, NSW, Australia",Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Sydney Institute of Marine Science,"Pillans, RD (corresponding author), CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",Richard.Pillans@csiro.au,"Bearham, Doug/G-8689-2011; Pillans, Richard/F-2458-2012; Thomson, Damian/C-3047-2014; Patterson, Toby/B-3836-2011; Babcock, Russell C/A-3794-2012","Pillans, Richard/0000-0001-6234-8764; Thomson, Damian/0000-0001-5485-1562; Babcock, Russell C/0000-0002-7756-1290; Patterson, Toby/0000-0002-7150-9205; Bearham, Douglas/0000-0002-2977-2843",Ocean Flagship of CSIRO; Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI); CSIRO; Australian Animal Tracking and Monitoring System (AATAMS); facility of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS),Ocean Flagship of CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI); CSIRO(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Australian Animal Tracking and Monitoring System (AATAMS); facility of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS),"This study was funded by the Wealth from Ocean Flagship of CSIRO and the Western Australia Marine Science Institute (WAMSI).

The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean. MethodsBull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N=86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation. ResultsA total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area. Main conclusionsExpansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts.

However, the importance of these habitats in sustaining marine species at seascape scales is debated, and their significance to reef shark populations is poorly understood. The blacktip reef shark Carcharhinus melanopterus is a widely distributed mobile marine predator; we explored its use of shallow, turbid coastal habitats in the Great Barrier Reef using tagging and acoustic telemetry. Residency and movement patterns of 23 individuals were monitored for up to 28 mo, revealing different patterns between sexes and sizes. Neonate/juveniles were short-term residents; adult females were long-term residents and preliminary data suggest that adult males were vagrants. Adult females and neonate/juveniles had small activity spaces (50% kernel utilisation distribution, KUD < 5 km(2)) and shared the same habitats and locations while adult males (when present) had larger activity spaces (50% KUD up to 14 km(2)). Population organisation, movement patterns and biological data suggest that blacktip reef sharks may use turbid coastal habitats for reproduction. This study reveals a new variation in coastal habitat use by sharks with habitat use patterns differing from those observed in other coastal sharks, and from conspecifics on coral reefs. These patterns do not conform to the characteristics of classical shark nurseries, and highlight the species' ecological flexibility. The study also demonstrates that shark behaviour and habitat use patterns can affect their vulnerability to fishing, habitat loss and climate change, and can affect the efficacy of marine protected areas.","[Chin, Andrew; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.; Tobin, Andrew J.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville Mail Ctr, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Chin, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",andrew.chin@jcu.edu.au,"Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Chin, Andrew/C-2254-2008","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332; Chin, Andrew/0000-0003-1813-4042",Australian Government through the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility Project 4.8.4; James Cook University; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; Australian Research Council,Australian Government through the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility Project 4.8.4(Australian Government); James Cook University; Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The authors thank funding agencies and collaborators, principally the Australian Government through the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility Project 4.8.4 and also James Cook University and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.

The critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) spends an extended part of its juvenile development in coastal waters. A strong proclivity to remain resident in small areas, often in high density, raises questions about how juveniles partition resources including selection of habitat and spatial overlap among conspecifics. Using between 36 and 41 acoustic receivers in the 1.5 km(2) study site, this study quantified day-and-night habitat selection, as well as 2D and 3D space use of 23 juvenile hawksbills within two adjacent Caribbean foraging grounds-Brewers Bay and Hawksbill Cove, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands-between 2015 and 2018. We found that coral reef, rock, and the artificial dolosse forming an airport runway, were the most strongly selected habitats based on resource selection indices. Individual activity spaces in 2D and 3D were both larger during the day compared to night, although the same parts of the bay were used by each individual during both periods. The 3D approach also showed deeper space use during the day. Weekly comparisons of activity space between individuals showed limited overlap (mean 95% UD overlap; day: 0.15 (2D) and 0.07 (3D), night: 0.11 (2D) and 0.03 (3D)), suggesting some degree of resource partitioning or territoriality. Results from this study provide relevant space use information for resource management of juvenile hawksbills, in which many populations are facing habitat degradation and population declines.","[Matley, J.

In two successive years, we surgically implanted transmitters in male and female bonefish (n = 60) and examined their movement patterns within the array. Eight bonefish surgically implanted with transmitters as part of an earlier study were also tracked. In 2009, the telemetry information was complemented with snorkeling observations, underwater video, and manual tracking of the same acoustically tagged fish, as well as fish (n = 3) gastrically implanted with continuous transmitters. During a period of 4-7 days spanning the full and new moons, primarily between October and May, bonefish moved from their typical shallow flats and aggregated at sites in close proximity to the deep water drop-off of the Exuma Sound. Localized movements of the large schools of bonefish (often > 1,000 fish) at these presumptive pre-spawning aggregation sites included brief trips (< 8 h) just after sunset until just prior to sunrise to the abyssal wall at the edge of the Exuma Sound (i.e., > 1,000 m depth). Tagged bonefish detected at these aggregation sites were subsequently detected back in the tidal creeks and coastal flats shortly after new and full moons and remained at these more typical shallow sites (i.e., < 2 m depth). Although we did not directly observe spawning events, we did observe ventral nudging and porpoising behaviors, which are potentially associated with courtship. Timing of the observed movements and possible courtship behaviors was coincident with periods when gametes were well developed. Collectively, our study provides the first objective evidence suggesting that the aggregation and seasonal migration of bonefish to deep shelf environments during certain moon phases is for spawning.","[Danylchuk, Andy J.; Haak, Christopher R.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Danylchuk, Andy J.; Cooke, Steven J.; Goldberg, Tony L.; Suski, Cory D.; Murchie, Karen J.; Danylchuk, Sascha E.; Shultz, Aaron D.; Haak, Christopher R.; Brooks, Edd J.; Oronti, Annabelle; Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Flats Ecol & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Cooke, Steven J.; Murchie, Karen J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Goldberg, Tony L.] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Vet Med, Dept Pathobiol Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Suski, Cory D.; Shultz, Aaron D.] Univ Illinois, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Brooks, Edd J.] Univ Plymouth, Sch Marine Sci & Engn, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England; [Koppelman, Jeff B.; Philipp, David P.] Illinois Nat Hist Survey, Inst Nat Resource Sustainabil, Champaign, IL 61820 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Carleton University; Carleton University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Plymouth; Illinois Natural History Survey,"Danylchuk, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 311 Holdsworth Hall,160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",danylchuk@eco.umass.edu,"Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010; Brooks, Edward/G-4697-2011","Suski, Cory/0000-0001-8280-873X; Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659","Bonefish and Tarpon Trust; Patagonia's World Trout Initiative; Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation; Baldwin Foundation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Carleton University; Cape Eleuthera Foundation; University of Illinois; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CGSD; Bahamas Department of Marine Resources; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture; Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and Department of Environmental Conservation [MAS00987]","Bonefish and Tarpon Trust; Patagonia's World Trout Initiative; Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation; Baldwin Foundation; Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Carleton University; Cape Eleuthera Foundation; University of Illinois; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CGSD(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Bahamas Department of Marine Resources; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); Massachusetts Agricultural Experiment Station and Department of Environmental Conservation","We gratefully acknowledge the staff, students, and volunteers of the Cape Eleuthera Institute and The Island School for logistical support and assistance with fieldwork, and in particular S.

Shelf-wide migrations of this stock are well documented, but movements and home ranges of fish during their inshore residency period have not been described. We tagged 122 Black Sea Bass with acoustic transmitters at a mid-Atlantic reef to estimate home-range size and factors that influence movements (>400 m) at a 46.1-km(2) study site between May and November 2003. Activity of Black Sea Bass was greatest and most consistent during summer but declined rapidly in September as water temperatures at the bottom of the seafloor increased on the inner shelf. Black Sea Bass maintained relatively large home ranges that were fish-size invariant but highly variable (13.7-736.4 ha), underscoring the importance of large sample sizes in examination of population-level characteristics of mobile species with complex social interactions. On the basis of observed variations in movement patterns and the size of home ranges, we postulate the existence of groups of conspecifics that exhibit similar space-use behaviors. The group of males released earlier in the tagging period used larger home ranges than the group of males released later in our study. In addition, mean activity levels and the probability of movement among acoustic stations varied among groups of fish in a complex manner that depended on sex. These differences in movement behaviors may increase the vulnerability of male fish to passive fishing gears, further exacerbating variation in exploitation rates for this species among reefs.","[Fabrizio, Mary C.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Manderson, John P.; Pessutti, Jeffrey P.] NOAA, James J Howard Marine Sci Lab, Noertheast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Highlands, NJ 07732 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"Fabrizio, MC (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",mfabrizio@vims.edu,,"Fabrizio, Mary/0000-0002-6115-5490",U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; Moses D.

Giant trevally appear to move to the Coconut Island marine reserve from the adjacent bay floor upon attaining a size of approximately 20-25 cm fork length. After several years spent frequenting the reserve, giant trevally move out of the bay into deeper water.

Fifteen P. areolatus were acoustically tagged and re-located within a ca. 50 km(2) search area over a 4-month period that included reproductive and non-reproductive months. All relocated fish were found in areas of moderate to high coral cover either on the fore reef or inside the lagoon in home ranges of 0.048 +/- A 0.018 km(2) (mu +/- A S.E.). Variability in home range area (0.004-0.12 km(2)) and distance of movement from aggregation sites following spawning (0.02-23.0 km; 5.3 +/- A 3.6 km, mu +/- A S.E.) was observed, but did not appear to be sex specific. Five of the six relocated individuals were found within 0.02-6.1 km of the aggregation.

The direct benefit of this protection, the so called 'reserve effect', is the build-up of biomass through an increase in individual numbers and size. This effect can take several years depending on the life history traits of the target species. However, empirical studies on individual fish spatial behaviour at temporal scales long enough to be compatible with that of invoking the reserve effect are still virtually lacking. We studied the inter-annual patterns of habitat use of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), an endangered reef fish predator, using passive acoustic telemetry inside and around a small marine reserve in the Azores, mid-north Atlantic. All 11 individuals resided in the reserve year-round for up to 5 years. During these periods, fish were detected nearly every day and utilised stable core activity areas. Two smaller fish apparently abandoned the area after some time, probably relocating outside the reserve. Our results indicate that even small marine reserves can promote the long-term recovery of some endangered species if the long-term behaviour (i.e. site fidelity) of individuals is appropriate. This result bears direct implications for most existing coastal marine reserves, given that they fall into the small size range and many overexploited reef fish species may be highly site attached.

Mortality on coral reefs is intrinsically linked with predation, with most evidence suggesting that predation is highest during crepuscular periods. We tested this hypothesis using passive acoustic telemetry data to determine the time of day of potential mortality events (PMEs) of adult herbivorous reef fishes. A total of 94 fishes were tagged with acoustic transmitters, of which 43 exhibited a PME. Furthermore, we identified five categories of PMEs based on the nature of change in acoustic signal detections from tagged fishes. The majority of PMEs were characterised by an abrupt stop in detections, possibly as a result of a large, mobile predator. Overall, mortality rates were estimated to be approximately 59 % per year using passive acoustic telemetry. The time of day of PMEs suggests that predation was highest during the day and crepuscular periods and lowest at night, offering only partial support for the crepuscular predation hypothesis. Visually oriented, diurnal and crepuscular predators appear to be more important than their nocturnal counterparts in terms of predation on adult reef fishes. By timing PMEs, passive acoustic telemetry may offer an important new tool for investigating the nature of predation on coral reefs.","[Khan, J. A.; Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

Yet, MPAs are often designed without sufficient ecological knowledge of the species they are intended to protect. This is particularly relevant to large and wide-ranging marine predators including many elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), for which region-specific space-use information is limited. Further, uncertainty remains in how to integrate movement datasets with systematic conservation planning frameworks to meet explicit conservation objectives. We addressed these knowledge gaps by combining movement models, constructed from passive acoustic telemetry data for eight elasmobranch species, and systematic conservation planning to investigate the design and adequacy of MPAs in Bimini, The Bahamas. Currently, there is a proposal for a no-take MPA in North Bimini (NBMPA), although it is unclear how this MPA would benefit elasmobranch communities if or when imple-mented. Our results show that although the NBMPA would contribute to elasmobranch conservation, the sup-plementation with an additional MPA southwest of Bimini would be necessary to protect important habitats for multiple elasmobranch species. This southwestern area was highlighted as a conservation priority area of both permanent MPA designs as well as seasonal time-area closures, regardless of NBMPA implementation status and conservation targets considered in this study. Our integrative approach also demonstrates its ability to optimize MPA designs for marine predator communities, combining multi-species movement models, constructed from acoustic telemetry datasets that include space-use estimates over multiple years, with MPA optimization tools.","[Bergmann, Maurits P.

We analysed similar to 2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.","[Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Fisheries & Aquat Sci Program, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Lowerre-Barbieri, Susan K.; Friess, Claudia; Bickford, Joel W.; Addis, Dustin T.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, St Petersburg, FL USA; [Griffin, Lucas P.; Morley, Danielle; Casselberry, Grace A.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Morley, Danielle; Acosta, Alejandro] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, South Florida Reg Lab, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Marathon, FL USA; [Skomal, Gregory B.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA USA; [Hammerschlag, Neil; Rider, Mitchell J.] Univ Miami, Rosenstiel Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Smukall, Matthew J.; van Zinnicq Bergmann, Maurits P.

This includes the optimal design of networks of marine reserves, as movements of fish are a major determinant for the reserve effect (increase in size and number inside reserves) and spillover effect (emigration from reserves). The increasing use of acoustic telemetry techniques, particularly passive acoustic arrays, is providing much of that information, but studies have typically used one specific approach at a specific spatial-temporal scale. We studied movement patterns, habitat use and dispersal in the red porgy, Pagrus pagrus (a commercially important species) in the Azores islands, mid-north Atlantic, with the aim of supporting the design of marine reserves that would protect local populations while enhancing fisheries. Movements were quantified using: (1) short-term active acoustic tracking; (2) multi-year passive acoustic monitoring; and (3) standard tag-release experiments in the Faial Channel. We found the short-term home ranges of red porgy to be quite large for a reef fish - up to 50 ha. Further-more, frequent short-term displacements of up to 9 km and periodic absences from main core activity areas indicate that HR varies considerably in size and location throughout the year. Home range expansion occurred mostly during the protracted period of spawning activity, but we saw no evidence for spawning aggregations. We found evidence that individuals of smaller size utilize larger home ranges and are less site-specific, supporting the hypothesis that dispersal in the red porgy is largely determined by ontogenic changes. Large individual variability in both short-term and long-term movement patterns accounted for some emigrations from tagging sites and for one documented relocation. These findings indicate that adequate protection of subpopulations of red porgy will not be achieved using small, isolated reserves (1 to 5 km(2)), but reserves of size in the order of tens of km(2) and spaced a few kilometers apart should provide protection while promoting emigration (spillover) of red porgy from reserves to neighboring grounds. This study shows that the combination of spatial and temporal scales and approaches is needed to capture a realistic picture of the full suite of spatial behaviors used throughout a species' life history.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Guedes, Rui; Tempera, Fernando; Holland, Kim N.; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, IMAR DOP, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Honolulu, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, IMAR DOP, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013; Tempera, Fernando/Q-1781-2018","Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589; Tempera, Fernando/0000-0001-9495-3731; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532",FCT/MCTES; Azorean DRCT; MAREFISH [FCT - POCTI/BSE/41207/2001]; MARMACII [IIIb-03/MAC/4.2/A2/2004],FCT/MCTES(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Azorean DRCT; MAREFISH; MARMACII,"We sincerely thank H.

This study quantified the residency and habitat use patterns of the juveniles and early adults of 2 commercially exploited snappers (Lutjanidae) in Santa Elena Bay, a tropical estuarine embayment influenced by a seasonal upwelling in the north Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Using an array of 28 acoustic receivers, we monitored 14 Colorado Lutjanus colorado (28.8-48.9 cm) and 16 Pacific dog L. novemfasciatus (22.5-49.3 cm) snappers over 22 mo. Both species were detected inside the bay over 60% of the monitoring days, showing higher relative abundance in mangrove and transitional estuarine habitats. Throughout the study, a shift in habitat use was observed for both species. Individuals moved from mangrove and transitional habitats to the outer reef habitat and exhibited a decreasing occurrence probability over time, suggesting they leave the bay as they mature. Season and environmental variables, e.g. temperature, had minimal or no effect on the occurrence of the tracked snappers in the bay. However, roaming varied seasonally, increasing during upwelling periods. These results suggest that habitat connectivity facilitates gradual life stage transitions, indicating that Santa Elena Bay likely supports essential fish habitat for commercially important species, particularly for L. novemfasciatus. Results also highlight the importance of integrating knowledge of the complex interplay of biological components (e.g. developmental and intra- and interspecific interactions) and seasonal habitat dynamics into conservation and management strategies.","[Vargas-Araya, L.; Espinoza, M.] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica; [Vargas-Araya, L.] Univ Costa Rica, Posgrad Gest Integrada Areas Costeras Trop, San Jose 206011501, Costa Rica; [Matley, J.

Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur 'travelling' costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate 'activity seascapes', which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Results: Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature. Conclusions: We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use. However, aspects of their foraging behavior may differ from other predictions of traditional CPF models. In particular, for species that never stop swimming, patch foraging times may be unrelated to patch travel distance.","[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL USA; [Watanabe, Yuuki Y.] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Yuuki Y.] SOKENDAI Grad Univ Adv Studies, Dept Polar Sci, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan; [Demsar, Urska] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Scotland; [Leos-Barajas, Vianey] Iowa State Univ, Dept Stat, Ames, IA USA; [Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Langrock, Roland] Bielefeld Univ, Dept Business Adm & Econ, Bielefeld, Germany; [Weng, Kevin] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Dept Fisheries Sci, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Research Organization of Information & Systems (ROIS); National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) - Japan; Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan; University of St Andrews; Iowa State University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Bielefeld; William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Geographic Society; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Demsar, U (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Scotland.",urska.demsar@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Watanabe, Yuuki/D-5079-2012; Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/C-4709-2013","Bradley, Darcy/0000-0003-2581-8768; Watanabe, Yuuki/0000-0001-9731-1769; Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/0000-0002-7069-7152; Demsar, Urska/0000-0001-7791-2807; Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841","Marisla Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25850138]; Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory/NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA05OAR4301108, NA09OAR43002]; Pelagic Fisheries Research Program/Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research [NA09OAR4320075]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25850138] Funding Source: KAKEN","Marisla Foundation(ACEV Foundation); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory/NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Pelagic Fisheries Research Program/Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by the Marisla Foundation, the Grants-in-Aids for scientific research from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (25850138), the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory/NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (NA05OAR4301108, NA09OAR43002), and the Pelagic Fisheries Research Program/Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (NA09OAR4320075).",,48,66,75,3,31,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2051-3933,,,MOV ECOL,Mov.

The relative and interactive effects of topography with biological and environmental noise have not been quantified on coral reefs. We conduct two long-term range tests (1- and 4-month duration) on two different reef types in the central Red Sea to determine the relative effect of distance, depth, topography, time of day, wind, lunar phase, sea surface temperature and thermocline on detection probability. Detectability, as expected, declines with increasing distance between tags and receivers, and we find average detection ranges of 530 and 120 m, using V16 and V13 tags, respectively, but the topography of the reef can significantly modify this relationship, reducing the range by similar to 70 %, even when tags and receivers are in line-of-sight. Analyses that assume a relationship between distance and detections must therefore be used with care. Nighttime detection range was consistently reduced in both locations, and detections varied by lunar phase in the 4-month test, suggesting a strong influence of biological noise (reducing detection probability up to 30 %), notably more influential than other environmental noises, including wind-driven noise, which is normally considered important in open-water environments. Analysis of detections should be corrected in consideration of the diel patterns we find, and range tests or sentinel tags should be used for more than 1 month to quantify potential changes due to lunar phase. Some studies assume that the most usual factor limiting detection range is weather-related noise; this cannot be extrapolated to coral reefs.","[Cagua, E. F.; Berumen, M. L.; Tyler, E. H.

Our study focused on three species (Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus microrhinos and Scarus ghobban), including a total of 30 fish. Fish were kept outside their natural environment for several days before release for pre- and post-tagging surveys. Moreover, 47% of them were not released at their capture site. Half of all individuals (all species) showed a high level of side fidelity immediately upon release. During this period, they were detected in the same place, by a small and constant number of hydrophones. This site fidelity pattern was also observed for the other fish (50%; all species) but after 1 to 18 days of an unsettled pattern, during which the fish moved significantly along the reef slope (high activity). During this short period, the distances travelled were significantly higher than during the subsequent period of site fidelity (several km vs. a few hundred m). We hypothesize that these unsettled patterns might result from fish experimental displacement (homing behavior) and from post-capture captivity (the fish had to recover a niche within the ecosystem). Consequently, we suggest that fish be released where they were caught to limit the movements associated with homing behavior. Periods of captivity should be avoided as much as possible. If this is not possible, a minimum acclimatization period of two or three weeks should be taken into account when analyzing the data.","[Chateau, Olivier] Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea, New Caledonia; [Wantiez, Laurent] Univ New Caledonia, CNRS, IFREMER, UMR,ENTROPIE,IRD,UR,UNC, Noumea, New Caledonia",Universite Nouvelle Caledonie; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ifremer,"Chateau, O (corresponding author), Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea, New Caledonia.",olivier.chateau@aquarium.nc,"Wantiez, Laurent/L-3343-2013","Wantiez, Laurent/0000-0001-5024-2057; CHATEAU, Olivier/0000-0003-1153-6284",ZoNeCo program (New Caledonia),ZoNeCo program (New Caledonia),Financial support for this study was provided by the ZoNeCo program (New Caledonia).Data availabilityThe material has not been previously published or simultaneously been submitted for publication elsewhere.,,27,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Taxa richness and fish abundance were greater in the early morning and in the late afternoon than during the day. Fourteen taxa displayed well-defined temporal patterns in abundance with one taxon influenced by time of day, six influenced by tidal state and seven influenced by both time of day and tidal state. None of these 14 taxa were piscivores, 10 were herbivore-detritus feeders, three were carnivores and one was plankton feeder.

One of the most important tourism sectors in aquatic environments is scuba diving, an activity considered sustainable given its non-extractive nature and capability of bringing relevant socio-economic benefits to local communities. However, knowledge about its impact on the activity patterns of aquatic animals is still scarce. Here, we used biotelemetry techniques to assess the importance of scuba diving in modulating the activity patterns of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus, Lowe, 1834), a marine predatory fish of high interest for fishing and tourism. We implemented Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on high-resolution acceleration data using a temporal and spatial control while controlling for a set of environmental variables (i.e. photoperiod, time-of-day, moon phase, temperature, wave height, and intensity and direction of marine currents) within a multiple-use marine protected area, and diving tourism hot-spot, of the western Mediterranean Sea. Our results underlined the more decisive influence of environmental-related stressors on the activity patterns of the dusky grouper compared to the impact of scuba diving. A high heterogeneity existed in the response against most of the stressors, including the presence of scuba divers. Overall, the activity of dusky grouper was higher at night than at day, showing a positive relationship with wave height, water temperature, and current intensity and a negative one with the moon phase. Remarkably, our findings, based on novel biotelemetry tools, differed substantially from the common wisdom accepted for this species. In conclusion, there is no clear evidence of scuba divers influence on the general activity patterns of the dusky grouper.

MCEs are often sites of fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) for a variety of species, including many groupers. Such reproductive fish aggregations represent temporal concentrations of potential prey that may be drivers of habitat use by predatory species, including sharks. We investigated movements of three species of sharks within a MCE and in relation to FSAs located on the shelf edge south of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. Movements of 17 tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), seven lemon (Negaprion brevirostris), and six Caribbean reef (Carcharhinus perezi) sharks tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored within the MCE using an array of acoustic receivers spanning an area of 1,060 km(2) over a five year period. Receivers were concentrated around prominent grouper FSAs to monitor movements of sharks in relation to these temporally transient aggregations. Over 130,000 detections of telemetered sharks were recorded, with four sharks tracked in excess of 3 years. All three shark species were present within the MCE over long periods of time and detected frequently at FSAs, but patterns of MCE use and orientation towards FSAs varied both spatially and temporally among species. Lemon sharks moved over a large expanse of the MCE, but concentrated their activities around FSAs during grouper spawning and were present within the MCE significantly more during grouper spawning season. Caribbean reef sharks were present within a restricted portion of the MCE for prolonged periods of time, but were also absent for long periods. Tiger sharks were detected throughout the extent of the acoustic array, with the MCE representing only portion of their habitat use, although a high degree of individual variation was observed. Our findings indicate that although patterns of use varied, all three species of sharks repeatedly utilized the MCE and as upper trophic level predators they are likely involved in a range of interactions with other members of MCEs.","[Pickard, Alexandria E.; Vaudo, Jeremy J.; Wetherbee, Bradley M.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova SE Univ, Guy Harvey Oceanog Ctr, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Wetherbee, Bradley M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Nemeth, Richard S.; Blondeau, Jeremiah B.; Kadison, Elizabeth A.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, USVI, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",Nova Southeastern University; University of Rhode Island; University of the Virgin Islands,"Wetherbee, BM (corresponding author), Nova SE Univ, Guy Harvey Oceanog Ctr, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 N Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA.;Wetherbee, BM (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",wetherbee@uri.edu,"Vaudo, Jeremy/AAE-6613-2020; Shivji, Mahmood/G-4080-2013",,Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy; US Geological Survey State Partnership Program; National Science Foundation; University of Rhode Island,Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy; US Geological Survey State Partnership Program(United States Geological Survey); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); University of Rhode Island,"Funding was provided by The Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation to MS, Puerto Rico Sea Grant to RN, NOAA Saltonstall-Kennedy to RN, US Geological Survey State Partnership Program to RN, National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research to RN, University of Rhode Island undergraduate research awards to BW.

Tags were surgically implanted in 5 snapper that were subsequently monitored every minute for a period of 5 mo, and then intermittently over another 7 mo. Site fidelity was high amongst these fish, with home ranges not exceeding 650 m in diameter or 139 600 m(2) in area. Eleven other snapper received tags by feeding and were tracked for periods of up to 2.5 d. Site fidelity was also high for these fish, with standardised estimates of home-range size not differing between the 2 groups. Home ranges overlapped considerably, indicating that the fish were not territorial. The location of the home ranges generally remained stable throughout the entire tracking period, although 1 fish relocated its home range by similar to220 m. A new method of home-range estimation was developed, which matched the level of detail provided by the RAPT system, to directly estimate the time spent in an area. The relevance of this method and the residential behaviour of these fish are discussed, with reference to the general understanding of animal behaviour, previous investigations into snapper movement, and the selective capacity that may be imposed by marine reserves on fish behaviour.","Univ Auckland, Leigh Marine Lab, Warkworth, New Zealand; Univ Auckland, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Auckland 1020, New Zealand; Dalhousie Univ, Dept Biol, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; Univ Tasmania, Inst Antarctic & So Ocean Studies, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; CSIRO Marine Res, Wembley, WA 6913, Australia; Univ Bologna, I-48100 Ravenna, Italy; Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; Census Marine Life, Washington, DC 20036 USA",University of Auckland; University of Auckland; Dalhousie University; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Bologna; University of Cambridge,"N Carolina State Univ, Dept Marine Earth & Atmospher Sci, Box 8208, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",darren.parsons@clear.net.nz,"Jackson, George/AAI-7315-2021; Willis, Trevor/F-5337-2012; Babcock, Russell C/A-3794-2012","Wilis, Trevor/0000-0002-0357-1189; Parsons, Darren/0000-0002-4030-512X; Babcock, Russell C/0000-0002-7756-1290",,,,,41,99,104,0,19,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

However, many knowledge gaps about their biology and ecology hinder conservation efforts. Here we used a combination of acoustic telemetry and acceleration datalogger technology to gain fundamental insights into the fine-scale behaviour, habitat use, size of activity spaces, and residency of adult female bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae) in the Ningaloo region of northwestern Australia. Acoustic tracking data over one year demonstrated that female bottlenose wedgefish continuously resided in a relatively small area of a productive coral reef lagoon. Acceleration data revealed that bottlenose wedgefish were nocturnal, with time of day having a greater influence on activity than tidal patterns. Bottlenose wedgefish also increased activity with seasonally increasing temperatures. We identified several discrete behavioural signatures in the acceleration data, inferred to correspond to chafing, settling/burying behaviour, foraging behaviour, and escape behaviour, based on their kinematics. Further observations are required to confirm these behaviours with certainty. Additionally, according to datalogger and acoustic data, tagged bottlenose wedgefish rarely inhabited areas greater than 2 m deep. Together, these first insights into behaviour and habitat use of adult female bottlenose wedgefish highlight the importance of nearshore habitats for this species and indicate that they may be highly resident to specific areas. Our findings provide important insight into the conservation of bottlenose wedgefish in northwestern Australia, including potential effectiveness of protected areas and interactions with specific anthropogenic threats such as shoreline development and recreational beach fishing.","[Lear, Karissa O.; Morgan, David L.; Gleiss, Adrian C.; Bateman, Rebecca L.] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Estrabeau, Carlos; Bateman, Rebecca L.] Fin Focus Res, Exmouth, WA, Australia; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Newport Aquarium, Newport, KY 41071 USA; [Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Environm & Conservat Sci, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Bignell, Colby] Environm Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Bignell, Colby] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas 7004, Australia; [Pillans, Richard D.] Environm Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Brisbane, Qld 4067, Australia",Murdoch University; Murdoch University; University of Tasmania; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Lear, KO (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",k.lear@murdoch.edu.au,"Pillans, Richard/F-2458-2012; Morgan, David/H-9794-2019; Gleiss, Adrian/E-5960-2011","Bignell, Colby James/0000-0003-4732-8655; Bateman, Rebecca/0000-0003-3282-1973; Morgan, David/0000-0003-1948-1484; Gleiss, Adrian/0000-0002-9960-2858; Lear, Karissa/0000-0002-2648-8564",CAUL; Murdoch University; Oceania Chondrichthyan Society; Minderoo Exmouth Field Laboratory; Artemis Films; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; Integrated Marine Observing System,CAUL; Murdoch University; Oceania Chondrichthyan Society; Minderoo Exmouth Field Laboratory; Artemis Films; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation(Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)); Integrated Marine Observing System,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.

We assessed ecosystem and trophic connectivity of two common reef fishes (schoolmaster, Lut-janus apodus; white grunt, Haemulon plumierii) and one predator (great barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda) in a Caribbean MSP ecosystem using acoustic telemetry and natural dietary tracers. Triangulated positions from an acoustic positioning system indicated that L. apodus and H. plumierii relied on multiple habitats within this MSP ecosystem, occupying areas with more cover (lower risk) during the day and areas with less cover (higher risk) at night. During the day, both species exhibited limited movement away from structured habitats (e.g., mangroves, patch reef) and avoided the primary activity space of S. barracuda in the central channel over sand bottom or seagrass. At night, L. apodus moved into the channel and adjacent seagrass beds on the margin of this high-risk area when S. barracuda occurrence was reduced, suggesting that this species adjusts its foraging activities to minimize encounter rates with predators. Haemulon plumierii also displayed distinct day-night shifts with directed movements at twilight across higher risk habitat to nighttime locations in seagrass. Conspicuous changes in the rate of movement were also detected at different times of the day, and observed mismatches between movement rates of S. barracuda and our two potential prey species appeared to be a behavioral response to reduce their vulnerability. Dietary tracer analysis supported the premise that observed shifts to nocturnal habitats were associated with foraging, with significant contributions of organic matter derived from nighttime locations. Findings from this study clearly demonstrate that the configuration of habitats and spatiotemporal variability in predation risk are key determinants of movement and foraging activities for these species, indicating that an improved understanding of seascape connectivity is critical to the management of reef-dependent species.","[Rooker, Jay R.; Dance, Michael A.; Wells, R.

The spatial and temporal movements of 19 sea bream (Archosargus rhomboidalis), an ecologically important species in mangrove estuaries of the western Atlantic, were investigated in multiple bays on a Caribbean Island over two years using surgically implanted acoustic transmitters. Fish were almost continuously monitored (residency index 96-100%) by an array of hydrophones during the 11-13 month battery-life of their transmitters. Individual fish utilized small core areas (mean = 9.8 ha during daytime and 11.0 ha at night), displayed daily site fidelity (mean = 57% overlap in day night core area), showed no evidence of an ontogenetic increase in core habitat size, and many exhibited a change in the bays utilized during winter months which is coincident with suspected spawning. Fish captured from the same bay generally occupied the same spaces within the study area, and in similar proportions, compared to fish captured in adjacent bays. Fish from different bays did not mix and wander throughout the ecosystem even though it is all suitable habitat and is used by different groups of localized individuals. This similarity of occupancy patterns is limited to the spatial scale of bays and temporal scales of weeks or months. When considered at the resolution of individual receivers and hourly time steps, most fish are not in close proximity to one another for the vast majority of the time. Although some pairs of fish had as many as 84% of their hourly detections on the same receivers in the month after tagging, they gradually spent less time near each other, even though their overall pattern of movements was consistent at the scale of whole bays. This highlights the importance of examining movements of fish on multiple spatial scales and time-intervals to understand their interactions.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Monaco, Mark E.; Winship, Arliss J.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, MSE,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss J.] CSS Inc, 10301 Democracy LaneSuite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ruffo, Ashley] ERT Inc, NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 3013 Estate Golden Rock, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA; [Holloway, Nathaniel Hanna] Natl Pk Serv, 2100 Church St 100, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i.e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics.","[Koeck, Barbara; Caro, Anthony; Neveu, Reda; Crec'hriou, Romain; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, F-66025 Perpignan, France; [Koeck, Barbara; Caro, Anthony; Neveu, Reda; Crec'hriou, Romain; Saragoni, Gilles; Lenfant, Philippe] CNRS, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, Perpignan, France; [Alos, Josep] Inst Mediterraneo Estudios Avanzados, IMEDEA CSIC UIB, Esporles, Illes Balears, Spain",Universite Perpignan Via Domitia; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Koeck, B (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, Ctr Format & Rech Environn Mediterraneens, Via Domitia, F-66025 Perpignan, France.",barbara.koeck@univ-perp.fr,"Koeck, Barbara/D-5174-2013; Lenfant, Philippe/D-3908-2009","Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539; Koeck, Barbara/0000-0001-7142-364X",French ministry of higher education and research; regional council of Languedoc-Roussillon (France),French ministry of higher education and research; regional council of Languedoc-Roussillon (France)(Region Occitanie),"This work was in partial fulfillment of the doctoral thesis of Barbara Koeck at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE, Paris), who was supported by a grant from the French ministry of higher education and research.

The extent of movement, residence time and seasonality of the aggregation can be difficult to determine, but are important for effective management. We utilized acoustic transmitters and a receiver array to track dog snapper Lutjanus jocu and Cubera snapper Lutjanus cyanopterus within a multi-species spawning aggregation site at the Grammanik Bank in the US Virgin Islands from June 2014 to September 2015. Acoustic detections showed that both species utilized spawning areas of 1.4 to 1.5 km(2), centered at the shelf promontory. The aggregation area of L. cyanopterus was situated along the shelf edge; the L. jocu aggregation may have been displaced by L. cyanopterus as it occupied some of the inner shelf as well. Receivers along the shelf edge recorded the longest residence times during the hours of spawning (16: 45 to 20: 00 h), suggesting this is likely a spawning site for both species. L. cyanopterus aggregated monthly from May through November, with residence time peaking in August. L. jocu aggregated monthly throughout the year and residence time did not vary significantly by month. Each month, detections increased in the week before and the first week after the full moon, but then decreased to zero by the third week after the full moon. This study outlines the spatial and temporal dimensions of the spawning aggregation, which can be applied to the management and development of protected areas.","[Biggs, Christopher R.] Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of the Virgin Islands,"Biggs, CR (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Marine Sci Inst, Port Aransas, TX 78373 USA.",cbiggs@utexas.edu,"BIGGS, CHRISTOPHER/AAN-7414-2020",,National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Conservation Program [NA13NOS 4820027]; Marine Fisheries Initiative-MARFIN [SE-2013-2003417]; V.

Geomagnetic cues are thought to guide long-range navigation, while visual or olfactory cues allow animals to pinpoint precise locations, but the complete behavioral sequence is not yet understood. Terra Ceia Bay is a primary nursery area for blacktip sharks, Carcharhinus limbatus, on southwestern Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. Young-of-theyear animals show strong fidelity to a specific home range in the northeastern end of the bay and rapidly return when displaced. Older juveniles demonstrate annual philopatry for the first few years, migrating as far south as the Florida Keys each fall, then returning to Terra Ceia Bay each spring. To examine the sensory cues used in homing, we captured neonate (53 weeks old) blacktip sharks from within their home range, fitted them with acoustic tags, and translocated them to sites 8km away in adjacent Tampa Bay and released them. Intact animals returned to their home range, within 34 h on average, and remained there. With olfaction blocked, fewer animals returned to their home range and they took longer to do so, 130 h on average. However, they did not remain there but instead moved throughout Terra Ceia Bay and in and out of Tampa Bay. Since sharks from both treatments returned at night in tannic and turbid water, vision is likely not playing a major role in navigation by these animals. The animals in this study also returned on incoming or slack tides, suggesting that sharks, like many other fish, may use selective tidal stream transport to conserve energy and aid navigation during migration. Collectively, these results suggest that while other cues, possibly geomagnetic and/or tidal information, might guide sharks over long distances, olfactory cues are required for recognizing their specific home range.","[Gardiner, Jayne M.] Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Gardiner, Jayne M.] New Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] Mote Marine Lab, Behav Ecol & Physiol Program, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Hueter, Robert E.] Mote Marine Lab, Ctr Shark Res, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA",Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; State University System of Florida; New College Florida; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium,"Gardiner, JM (corresponding author), Mote Marine Lab, Sensory Biol & Behav Program, 1600 Ken Thompson Pkwy, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA.",jgardiner@ncf.edu,,"Gardiner, Jayne/0000-0002-9989-2891",Florida Sea Grant [PD-12-04]; Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship,Florida Sea Grant; Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship,This work was supported by Florida Sea Grant (PD-12-04) and a Mote Postdoctoral Fellowship [to J.M.G.].,,114,24,29,2,128,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1540-7063,1557-7023,,INTEGR COMP BIOL,Integr.

However, animal home ranges often change with ontogeny, and quantifying the associated temporal and spatial changes is particularly challenging for mobile marine species. Here, we investigated how the space use of a top predatory reef-associated fish (giant trevally Caranx ignobilis) scales with body size. Fish were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively tracked for > 3 yr at a tropical island and atoll in the Republic of Seychelles. A sheltered atoll environment was critical for juvenile fish (< 60 cm fork length, FL) that exhibited a shift in home range location and area as they matured into adults. Small (60-100 cm FL) and large (>100 cm FL) adult fish appeared to favour shallow coral reefs and associated reef drop offs whilst sharing a similar core home range location. Large adult fish utilized a greater diversity of habitat types and had significantly (p < 0.05) greater annual dispersal distances (mean = 35.29 km, max = 91.32 km) than small adults (mean = 13.72 km, max = 21.55 km). Additionally, the home range of large adults (mean = 209.74 km(2)) was significantly (p < 0.05) larger than that of juveniles (mean = 38.73 km(2)) and small adults (77.32 km(2)) and there was a significant (p = 0.02) relationship between fish length and home range size. Furthermore, tagged fish took up to 34 mo (mean = 18.54 mo) to utilize the full extent of their home range. The habitat shift and expansion in home range size throughout ontogeny should be taken into account when designing effective spatial management plans for C. ignobilis.","[Daly, R.; Mann, B.

We used acoustic telemetry to determine movements and habitat use of these sharks at the isolated Rowley Shoals atolls, 250 km off the coast of north-western Australia. We equipped 12 male and 14 female sharks ranging from 0.79 to 1.69 m in total length with transmitters that were detected by an array of 11 strategically placed receivers on two atoll reefs. Over 26,000 detections were recorded over the 325 days of receiver deployment. No sharks were observed to move between reefs. Receivers on the outer slopes of reefs provided nearly all (99%) of the detections. We found no differences in general attendance parameters due to size, sex or reef, except for maximum period of detection where larger sharks were detected over a longer period than smaller sharks. Male and female sharks were often detected at separate receivers at the outer slope habitat of one reef, suggesting sexual segregation, but this pattern did not occur at the second reef where males and females were detected at similar frequencies. We identified two patterns of daily behaviour: (1) sharks were present at the reef both day and night or (2) sharks spent more time in attendance during day than at night. Fast Fourier transforms identified 24-h cycles of attendance at the reef and a secondary peak of attendance at 12 h for most sharks, although no individuals shared the same attendance patterns. Our study provides baseline data that can be used to optimise the minimum area and habitat requirements for conservation of these apex predators.","[Field, I. C.; Meekan, M. G.; Speed, C.

Despite a wide Indo-Pacific distribution, little is known about the spatial ecology of silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus), compromising the ability to effectively manage their populations. We examined the residency and movements of silvertip sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 VR2W acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Twenty-seven individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored from 70 to 731 d. Residency index to the study site ranged from 0.05 to 0.97, with a mean residency (+/- SD) of 0.57 +/- 0.26, but most individuals were detected at or near their tagging reef. Clear seasonal patterns were apparent, with fewer individuals detected between September and February. A large proportion of the tagged population (> 71 %) moved regularly between reefs. Silvertip sharks were detected less during daytime and exhibited a strong diel pattern in depth use, which may be a strategy for optimizing energetic budgets and foraging opportunities. This study provides the first detailed examination of the spatial ecology and behavior of silvertip sharks on coral reefs. Silvertip sharks remained resident at coral reef habitats over long periods, but our results also suggest this species may have more complex movement patterns and use larger areas of the GBR than common reef shark species. Our findings highlight the need to further understand the movement ecology of silvertip sharks at different spatial and temporal scales, which is critical for developing effective management approaches.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle.

However, few studies have focused on the fine-scale movements related to reproduction, a key feature in a population's perpetuation. Knowledge of movements modulated by reproduction is particularly important since migrations towards spawning grounds may increase the vulnerability to threats if these occur outside protected areas. Further, reproductive behavioural polymorphism is widely understudied but may affect reproductive success. In this work, we used acoustic telemetry to study a harvested fish, Diplodus sargus, within a small no-take zone in Portugal. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to focus on both the environmental and spatial features affecting D. sargus reproduction and the first to explore intraspecific variability of spawning movements. We report, during the spawning period, short-term (<1 d) and synchronised wider movements towards the open sea and deeper areas-'extraordinary movements'-involving 34% of the individuals. These extraordinary movements were associated with environmental factors known to trigger reproduction in this species (low but increasing photoperiod and temperature, waxing and full moon phases). Our results suggest that different behavioural groups (residents, commuters and low site-attached fish) exhibiting differences in spatial use may aggregate and spawn simultaneously, which may contribute to the maintenance of behavioural polymorphisms and the species' evolutionary adaptability. These findings have implications for the conservation of D. sargus and are relevant to other species that also conduct such critical migrations. Our results should enable adaptive management of fisheries targeting this species.","[Pedaccini, Marie; Sousa, Ines; Bentes, Luis; DeBenito-Abello, Carmela; Goncalves, Jorge M.

While the spatial scales over which these processes occur have been evaluated, the spatial ecology of individual taxa responsible for shaping these processes is almost entirely unknown. This study combined acoustic telemetry and ecological assessments to evaluate the movement patterns and feeding range of a functionally important coral reef fish, Chlorurus microrhinos (f. Labridae). The diurnal home range and feeding areas of C. microrhinos, on Orpheus Island, Great Barrier Reef, were quantified using active acoustic telemetry. The average diurnal home range of C. microrhinos was 7,830 m(2) +/- 940 (SE). Core areas of activity (50% kernel utilization distributions) were relatively small, encompassing approximately 22% of an individual's home range (1,690 m(2) +/- 220). Core areas exhibited greater topographic complexity. C. microrhinos may select these areas because of decreased predation risk. Feeding intensities were not homogenous throughout the home range. Core areas were found to have a greater number of feeding scars and are thus exposed to increased bioerosion and algal removal by C. microrhinos. While important in shaping key ecosystem processes, the ecosystem impact of individual C. microrhinos in Pioneer Bay appears to be restricted to small areas within a narrow band along the reef crest.","[Welsh, J.

However, conservation outcomes of MPAs for mobile and long-lived predators such as sharks are highly variable. Here, we use empirical animal tracking data from 459 individual sharks and baited remote underwater video surveys undertaken in 36 countries to construct an empirically supported individual-based model that estimates the conservation effectiveness of MPAs for five species of coral reef-associated sharks (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus perezi, and Ginglymostoma cirratum). We demonstrate how species-specific individual movement traits can contribute to fishing mortality of sharks found within MPAs as they move outside to adjacent fishing grounds. We discovered that the world's officially recorded coral reef-based managed areas (with a median width of 9.4 km) would need to be enforced as strict no-take MPAs and up to 5 times larger to expect protection of the majority of individuals of the five investigated reef shark species. The magnitude of this effect depended on local abundances and fishing pressure, with MPAs required to be 1.6-2.6 times larger to protect the same number of Atlantic and Caribbean species, which occur at lower abundances than similar species in the western Pacific. Furthermore, our model was used to quantify partially substantial reductions (>50%) in fishing mortality resulting from small increases in MPA size, allowing us to bridge a critical gap between traditional conservation planning and fisheries management. Overall, our results highlight the challenge of relying on abundance data alone to ensure that estimates of shark conservation impacts of MPAs follow the precautionary approach.","[Dwyer, Ross G.; Krueck, Nils C.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Dwyer, Ross G.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Dwyer, Ross G.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Krueck, Nils C.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Udyawer, Vinay] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Arafura Timor Res Facil, Darwin, NT 0810, Australia; [Udyawer, Vinay] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Chapman, Demian] Florida Int Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Biol Sci, 151st St, North Miami, FL USA; [Pratt, Harold L., Jr.] Elizabeth Moore Int Ctr Coral Reef Res & Restorat, Mote Marine Lab, Summerland Key, FL USA; [Pratt, Harold L., Jr.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, 1 Cent Wharf, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Garla, Ricardo] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Norte, Dept Bot & Zool, Ave Senador Salgado Filho, BR-59064741 Natal, RN, Brazil",University of Queensland; James Cook University; James Cook University; University of Tasmania; Australian Institute of Marine Science; Charles Darwin University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,"Dwyer, RG; Krueck, NC (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;Dwyer, RG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Dwyer, RG (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Krueck, NC (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",ross.dwyer@uq.edu.au; nils.krueck@utas.edu.au,"Udyawer, Vinay/L-9432-2019; Dwyer, Ross/IQR-5509-2023; Pratt, Harold/AAK-9544-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011; Garla, Ricardo/A-2990-2014","Garla, Ricardo/0000-0002-0827-225X; Dwyer, Ross/0000-0003-1136-5489; Udyawer, Vinay/0000-0001-5812-0740",Shark Conservation Fund; Paul G.

The presence and movement of 28 grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos were monitored for 15 mo in the southern Great Barrier Reef in relation to environmental conditions and biological factors. Twenty-eight models including water temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, rainfall and time (week or month), size and sex were tested against presence and activity space data and compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Model results for presence of individuals in relation to environmental conditions indicated that temperature and wind speed had weak effects, likely related to detectability. Models using 3 different measures of activity space indicated no relationship between shark activity space and environmental parameters. Week was a significant factor in the top performing activity space models, with males showing increased activity space during weeks in September, when mating is believed to occur. These results suggest changes in movement were biologically rather than environmentally driven. It appears that C. amblyrhynchos are adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions in coral reef habitats and that movement between or away from reef platforms is likely related to biological factors such as prey density, competition, reproduction or dispersal rather than environmental or seasonal changes.","[Heupel, M.

However, to benefit local fisheries through spillover, the species in the reserves must also be able to migrate to unprotected areas. We evaluated the optimal design of marine reserves for protecting and promoting spillover of a commercially important parrotfish, Sparisoma cretense (Linnaeus, 1758), by empirically quantifying short- and long-term movements of individuals originally captured inside and outside a small reserve in the Azores Islands (mid-Atlantic). Movements were quantified using active tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-recapture. We found that the dual social organization of the species determined the individuals' movements and habitat use. Haremic fish occupied small HRs associated with permanently established male territories in high energy reef areas. Group (schooling) fish spent most of their time in sheltered reefs but expanded their HRs during the spawning season with daily migrations to the 'territorial' areas. S. cretense HR sizes were considerably larger than those previously reported for tropical parrotfishes. Passive acoustic monitoring indicated very high site fidelity and minimal dispersion for up to 30 mo. This study demonstrates that residency of adult parrotfish can last for years. Several individuals emigrated to the reserve from neighbouring areas and some of them relocated thereafter. We suggest that a network of adequately enforced marine reserves of small to medium size (ca. 1 to 5 km(2)) containing suitable habitat diversity can effectively protect core populations of S. cretense, but benefits to adjacent fisheries through spillover will be limited to the areas adjacent to the reserve boundaries.","[Afonso, Pedro; Fontes, Jorge; Santos, Ricardo S.] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal; [Afonso, Pedro; Holland, Kim N.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Dept Zool, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",Universidade dos Acores; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Afonso, P (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Cais Santa Cruz, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",afonso@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Serrao Santos, Ricardo/B-3960-2008; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Serrao Santos, Ricardo/0000-0002-2536-1369; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589",,,,,31,96,110,0,38,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

This study used acoustic telemetry to investigate movements of reef fish relative to the boundary of the Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument (VICRNM) in Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands. Although created to enhance ecosystem protection, VICRNM boundaries were established purely on the basis of adjacency to public versus privately owned lands. Transmitters were implanted into a diversity of reef fish species representative of the local community whose movements were logged for one year on an array of acoustic-receivers that were positioned within, outside, and along the MPA boundary. Results indicate that the boundary has coincidentally aligned with a deep sandy area that does not cross through continuous reef or mangrove habitat. This acted as a natural barrier to movements of species such as Lutjanus griseus, Epinephelus guttatus, Cephalopholus cruentatus, Holocentrus rufus, and Sparisoma aurofrenatum. Other species were more mobile and were routinely detected outside VICRNM, especially at night, such as L. synagris, Haemulon plumierii, and H. sciurus. In addition to fish movements in relation to the VICRNM boundary, network analysis revealed several hotspots of concentrated fish activity including a reef promontory and bay mouths. Investment in enforcement of existing regulations to protect fish is warranted to realize the full potential of this MPA. Using these types of data, management actions in this and other MPAs can be focused on those species and locations that would experience the greatest benefit.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, CCMA,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] CSS Dynamac Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Monaco, Mark E.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, Ctr Coastal Monitoring & Assessment, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

Marine reserves can regulate how human activities alter fish communities and increase the abundance of targeted species, but the combined influence of reserves and seascape context on species habitat use remains uncertain in many ecosystems. Further, marine reserve effectiveness might be low for mobile species if the size of the reserve is less than a species usual range, reducing the overall time a individual may be protected. In this study, we tracked 19 giant shovelnose rays (Glaucostegus typus), an IUCN listed vulnerable species within the Moreton Bay Marine Park in eastern Australia. We used an array of 28 acoustic receivers within a complex mosaic of seagrass patches, bare sand, mangrove forests and deep-water channels and used regression tree analyses to determine which spatial, temporal and protection factors contributed most to G. typus habitat use. Overall, 50% of the total detections in the study occurred inside marine reserves containing large seagrass beds (>7.09 m(2)) and in close proximity to mangroves (<7.47 km). During winter (<20.2 degrees C), G. typus centre of activity increased significantly (p < 0.001), and greater than 50% of the detections occurred in reserves in winter. Conversely, during the rest of the year (water temperature > 20.2 degrees C), the habitat use of individuals is contained in smaller centres of activity compared with winter, however, protection effects varied. Our results show that seascape context and marine reserves combine to provide the optimal areas for G. typus habitat selection. Limited food resources likely caused larger centres of activity during winter. Identifying priority habitats for vulnerable species is critical for ongoing protection and maintaining effective conservation initiatives. We have shown here that incorporating spatial features into the design of marine reserves can improve conservation outcomes for mobile benthic predators such as G. typus and other species that use such seascapes.","[Henderson, Christopher J.; Stevens, Tim; Lee, Shing Y.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia; [Henderson, Christopher J.; Stevens, Tim; Lee, Shing Y.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia; [Henderson, Christopher J.; Gilby, Ben L.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; University of the Sunshine Coast,"Henderson, CJ (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia.;Henderson, CJ (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Sch Environm, Gold Coast Campus, Griffith, Qld 4222, Australia.;Henderson, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Maroochydore, Qld 4558, Australia.",christopher.henderson@griffithuni.edu.au,"Lee, Shing Yip/B-9185-2008","Lee, Shing Yip/0000-0001-9336-2323",Margaret Middleton Fund as part of the Australian Academy of Science,Margaret Middleton Fund as part of the Australian Academy of Science,"Funding for this project was provided by the Margaret Middleton Fund as part of the Australian Academy of Science.

Range testing and visual observations revealed the limitations of using small acoustic transmitters to monitor movements of small coral reef fish in a topographically complex and noisy coral reef environment. Visual observations of conventionally tagged and albino fish suggest individuals return each day to forage over the same few hundred m(2) of shallow, turf algae dominated boulder and reef flat habitat for periods of at least weeks to months. Acoustic telemetry data suggest lower frequency of repeated use of daytime foraging, nighttime refuge and sunset spawning sites. However, integration of observation and acoustic telemetry data revealed that many fish were not detected while they were within the empirically tested range of the receivers. These observations indicate that data from passive acoustic telemetry can underestimate the frequency and duration of repeated use of specific areas. Yellow tang adults made daily crepuscular migrations of up to 600 m between foraging and spawning or sheltering sites at consistent times relative to sunset and sunrise. While there was high individual variability in migration distance, almost all individuals moved in the same direction (from south to north) at sunset.

To support community-based management of an artisanal fishery that targets bonefish (Albula glossodonta) spawning aggregations, we used a combination of acoustic telemetry, biological sampling, and remote imagery to reveal the spatiotemporal spawning migrations of bonefish on Anaa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia. The spawning migrations of bonefish tracked with acoustic telemetry were restricted to the northern section of the atoll, with 99.6% of all detections at offshore spawning habitats occurring on fixed acoustic receivers adjacent to the atoll's artisanal fish trap complex. Male bonefish undertook spawning migrations more frequently than females and these spawning migrations were common during the Austral winter and fall. The movements of bonefish spawning aggregations coincided with the lunar cycle, as a network analysis revealed an increase in network size and the diversity of habitat use within our acoustic array throughout the duration of the waning moon. Our results highlighted the need for the management of the artisanal trap fishery to prevent the overharvest of bonefish during their peak spawning periods. In response to the spatiotemporal management recommendations derived from this research, the local government established an Educational Managed Marine Area that includes the atoll's bonefish spawning migratory corridor adjacent to Tukuhora village and aRahui(i.e., seasonal closure) to improve the sustainability of the fishery.","[Filous, Alexander; Danylchuk, Andy J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, 160 Holdsworth Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Filous, Alexander; Lennox, Robert J.; Danylchuk, Andy J.] Indifly, POB 4460, St Paul, MN 55104 USA; [Filous, Alexander; Raveino, Raphael] Isl Initiat, Fam Ridge Rd, Althorne Hall Farm, Althorne, England; [Lennox, Robert J.; Cooke, Steven J.] Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Fish Ecol & Conservat Physiol Lab, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Lennox, Robert J.] Norwegian Res Ctr NORCE, Lab Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Bergen, Norway; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Pristine Seas, Washington, DC USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii, Dept Biol, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Clua, Eric E.

A series of acoustic receivers deployed throughout south-eastern Tasmania as well as a receiver array along an isolated reef, Crayfish Point Reserve (CPR), passively tracked 25 C. laticeps from January to July 2003. Cephaloscyllium laticeps were present from 4 to 98 days. The majority of the C. laticeps stayed within the CPR where most individuals were active throughout the night. They were found actively moving (i.e. when a C. laticeps was consecutively detected by two or more non-overlapping receivers, suggesting the individual was moving) and spending periods of minor movements (i.e. when an individual was consecutively detected by only one receiver, suggesting it was at rest). The length of these minor movements periods, observed both day and night, ranged from 1 h to 5 days. In addition to passive tracking, 1552 conventionally tagged C. laticeps were released in the eastern and south-western coastal areas of Tasmania and within the CPR between January 2000 and April 2007. The CPR showed a higher recapture rate, 38%, than eastern and south-western areas where the recapture rates were 10 and 3%, respectively. Within the CPR, 36% of the sharks were recaptured on multiple occasions. The maximum time at liberty ranged from 1 month to 7 years. The majority of the C. laticeps were recaptured in the vicinity of where they were released (<10 km), although larger longer-term movements of up to 300 km were recorded. The large amount of multiple recaptures within the CPR, in addition to acoustic tagging results, indicated a high degree of site fidelity for C. laticeps. This isolated reef appears to be an important habitat for this species, and therefore, the current protection status of this area is probably beneficial for the conservation of C. laticeps.

The eastern blue groper, Achoerodus viridis, is a long-lived, protogynous hermaphrodite, and an iconic' marine species in eastern Australia, with several MPAs having been established specifically for their protection. Site fidelity, habitat use, and home range size were assessed for 29 adult eastern blue gropers monitored for up to 374days using passive acoustic telemetry within and around a small marine reserve. The fish exhibited long residency times and no movement was recorded between adjacent reefs, suggesting sand acts as a natural barrier to movement. Core ranges were calculated using 50% kernel utilization distributions (KUD) and estimated between 0.005 and 0.092km(2). Males had larger core ranges than females or fish of indeterminate sex. There was no statistical difference between the breeding/non-breeding seasons. Home ranges were calculated using 95% KUD and ranged between 0.03 and 0.54km(2). Home range size was largest for males and significantly larger for all sexes in the breeding season. Fish tagged in the no-take' area of the MPA had smaller home ranges than fish tagged in the area where fishing is permitted. This study indicates that even relatively small MPAs can provide effective protection for adult eastern blue groper, supporting the proposition that large reef dwellers with long residency times can be used as flagship species to gain public support for the designation of MPAs.

We observed 4 species of reef sharks aggregating in an inshore bay in the north of Western Australia for over 2 yr, using acoustic telemetry and visual censuses to examine how they partitioned this site in space and time. We fitted 58 sharks with acoustic transmitters: Carcharhinus melanopterus (36), C. amblyrhynchos (11), Negaprion acutidens (7) and Triaenodon obesus (4). Aggregations consisted primarily of C. melanopterus, although C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens were often present. We observed aggregations by visual census in summer (maximum of 44 sharks). Detections were highest during warmer months (Sep to Mar) for all species, although some individuals showed year-round residency. C. melanopterus, C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens had strong diel patterns of attendance at the aggregation site. Peak daily detections occurred from 13: 00 to 14: 00 h local time for C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos; juvenile C. melanopterus and N. acutidens peaked at 05:00 and 10:00 h, respectively. There was considerable spatial overlap of core areas of use (50% kernel density estimates) at the northern end of the bay by all species; the southern end was used primarily by C. melanopterus and N. acutidens. Aggregations of C. melanopterus and C. amblyrhynchos consisted mainly of adult females, some of them pregnant. Courtship behaviour in C. melanopterus and T. obesus suggests that these aggregations are related to reproduction. All species displayed inter-annual site fidelity. The long-term presence of juvenile C. melanopterus and N. acutidens also suggests that this bay provides suitable conditions for younger age classes.","[Speed, Conrad W.; Meekan, Mark G.; Berger, Yuval] Australian Inst Marine Sci, UWA Oceans Inst M096, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Speed, Conrad W.; Field, Iain C.; McMahon, Clive R.] Charles Darwin Univ, Sch Environm Res, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Field, Iain C.] Macquarie Univ, Grad Sch Environm, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Stevens, John D.] CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Hobart, Tas 7000, Australia; [McGregor, Frazer] Murdoch Univ, Field Stn, Coral Bay, WA 6701, Australia; [Huveneers, Charlie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Huveneers, Charlie; Bradshaw, Corey J.

We assessed the fine and broad scale movement patterns of an exploited herbivore, luderick (Girella tricuspidata), using acoustic telemetry to evaluate how this species may respond to protection within Jervis Bay (New South Wales, Australia). We surgically implanted fourteen fish with acoustic transmitters and actively and passively tracked individuals to determine fine and broad scale movement patterns respectively. Eight fish were actively tracked for 24 h d(1) for 6 d (May 2011), and then intermittently over the following 30 d. Six fish were passively tracked from December 2011 to March 2012, using a fixed array of receivers deployed across rocky reefs around the perimeter of the bay. Luderick exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs, tending to remain on or return consistently to the reef where they were caught and released. All eight fish actively tracked used core areas solely on their release reef, with the exception of one fish that used multiple core areas, and four of the six fish passively tracked spent between 75 to 96% of days on release reefs over the entire tracking period. Luderick did move frequently to adjacent reefs, and occasionally to more distant reefs, however consistently returned to their release reef. Luderick also exhibited predictable patterns in movement between spatially distinct daytime and night-time core use areas. Night-time core use areas were generally located in sheltered areas behind the edge of reefs. Overall, our data indicate luderick exhibit strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs in Jervis Bay and suggests that this important herbivore may be likely to show a positive response to protection within the marine park.","[Ferguson, Adrian M.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Ferguson, Adrian M.; Harvey, Euan S.] Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, Sch Plant Biol, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Ferguson, Adrian M.] Univ Wollongong, Sch Biol Sci, Inst Conservat Biol & Environm Management, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Taylors Beach, NSW, Australia; [Knott, Nathan A.] Jervis Bay Marine Park, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Huskisson, NSW, Australia",University of Western Australia; University of Western Australia; University of Wollongong; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Ferguson, AM (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Fac Nat & Agr Sci, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia.",adrianferguson79@gmail.com,"Knott, Nathan/AAA-8888-2019; Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Harvey, Euan/B-2896-2011","Knott, Nathan/0000-0002-7873-0412; Harvey, Euan/0000-0002-9069-4581",University of Western Australia; Jervis Bay Marine Park; NSW Department of Primary Industries; NSW Marine Parks Authority; Booderee National Park,University of Western Australia; Jervis Bay Marine Park; NSW Department of Primary Industries; NSW Marine Parks Authority; Booderee National Park,"The sources of funding that have supported this work include: The University of Western Australia, Jervis Bay Marine Park, NSW Department of Primary Industries, NSW Marine Parks Authority, Booderee National Park.

Bluespine unicornfish were site-attached to home ranges situated within the reserve boundaries and their movements were aligned with topographic features. Two different diel movement patterns ('commuting' and 'foraying') were observed. Commuters made crepuscular migrations of several hundred meters between daytime foraging areas and nighttime refuge holes. Foraying fish did not partake in crepuscular migrations and utilized refuge holes both day and night. Two bluespine unicornfish were also nocturnally active. There was little direct evidence of dispersal from the reserve but differences in bluespine unicornfish abundance and size among reef habitat zones were consistent with ontogenetic habitat shifts. The influence of habitat topography on bluespine unicornfish movements suggests that gross habitat characteristics could be used to predict reef fish movements. This could provide a simple method for setting marine reserve boundaries at sites for which empirical fish movement data are unavailable.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021",,,,,,37,100,114,0,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Part of the original rebuilding plan included designation of a yelloweye rockfish conservation area, a rocky reef closed off the Central Coast of Oregon that is closed to bottom fishing. The yelloweye rockfish conservation area's ability to help rebuild the population, is predicated on the theory that demersal rockfishes are relatively sedentary. However, in the years since being declared overfished, acoustic tagging studies suggested yelloweye rockfish did not remain in the yelloweye rockfish conservation area. However, where they went remained a mystery. In this paper we describe the use of pop-off satellite tags to conduct a mark-recapture study of 11 yelloweye rockfish tagged within the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area. We used back-in-time particle tracking coupled with an ocean circulation model in an attempt to increase the precision in the location at which each tag shed off the fish, and further validated that location by associating it to the underlying seafloor habitat type. Ten out of eleven tags were shed from the fish while it was outside the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area's boundary. While most fish remained within 50 km of the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area, one tagged fish swam to an offshore reef off Central Washington (similar to 40 km from the shore). Backtracked locations were more likely over rock than the initial satellite transmission, indicating the method was effective at identifying tag shed locations. We found no relationship between days at large, fish sex or length and the distance between release site and shed location. Our work supports a growing body of work that suggests yelloweye rockfish have less site fidelity than previously hypothesized.","[Rasmuson, Leif K.; Blume, Matthew T.

Twelve adults were caught along the north-eastern coast of a small Mediterranean island, tagged with acoustic transmitters and released within or just outside the integral reserve. Fish detected, during both the seasons showed strong fidelity for the study area before and during the spawning season and their home range did not differ between seasons. Home ranges reached an asymptote between 12 and 174 days after release. Home range estimated by kernel utilization distributions ranged from 9,876 to 89,914 m(2), with core areas of 946 to 7,274 m(2). Temporal patterns frequently showed a dominant diel rhythm with most of detections occurring at daytime, independently of season. The variability in the movement patterns of D. vulgaris was lower between seasons (i.e., during and outside the spawning season) than at smaller temporal scale (i.e., between day and night) and was largely affected by inter-individual differences.

Passive acoustic monitoring was used to investigate spatial and temporal variations in the presence and foraging activity of harbor porpoises off the Oregon coast from May through October 2014. Digital monitoring devices (DMONs) were deployed to record acoustic data (320 kHz sample rate) in two neighboring but bathymetrically different locations off the Oregon coast: (1) a site on the 30 m isobath in close proximity (<50 m) to a rocky reef, and (2) a site on the 60 m isobath in an open sandy environment. Data were analyzed with respect to two dynamic cyclic variables: diel and tidal phase. Porpoise presence at the rocky reef site was aligned with the ebb phase of the tidal forcing, while, harbor porpoise presence and foraging at the offshore, sandy bottom site was associated with night-time foraging. The spatial and temporal patterns identified in this study suggest harbor porpoise habitat use is modulated by specific environmental conditions particular to each site that maximize foraging efficiency.","[Holdman, Amanda K.; Torres, Leigh G.] Oregon State Univ, Marine Mammal Inst, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Holdman, Amanda K.; Haxel, Joseph H.] Oregon State Univ, Cooperat Inst Marine Resources Studies, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Holdman, Amanda K.; Haxel, Joseph H.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Klinck, Holger] Cornell Univ, Bioacoust Res Program, Cornell Lab Ornithol, 159 Sapsucker Woods Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Holdman, Amanda K.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, 1300 Univ Blvd, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",Oregon State University; Oregon State University; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Cornell University; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Holdman, AK (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Marine Mammal Inst, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.;Holdman, AK (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Cooperat Inst Marine Resources Studies, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.;Holdman, AK (corresponding author), NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, Hatfield Marine Sci Ctr, 2030 SE Marine Sci Dr, Newport, OR 97365 USA.;Holdman, AK (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, 1300 Univ Blvd, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",amandaholdman@gmail.com,"Klinck, Holger/X-5214-2019; Holdman, Amanda/JJE-5240-2023","Torres, Leigh/0000-0002-2643-3950; Holdman, Amanda/0000-0001-8757-9593",U.S. Department of Energy Award [DE-FG36-08GO18179-M001]; Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center; Oregon Sea Grant,U.S. Department of Energy Award(United States Department of Energy (DOE)); Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center; Oregon Sea Grant,"This study was supported with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Award # DE-FG36-08GO18179-M001 and the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center.

Here, we report on the horizontal movements and residency of juvenile reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) at a recently discovered nursery site in the Wayag lagoon, Raja Ampat, Indonesia. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, we provide further corroborative evidence that the lagoon serves as an important M. alfredi nursery. A total of 34 juvenile rays were photo-identified from 47 sightings in the sheltered nursery between 2013-2021. Five (14.7%) of these individuals were resighted for at least 486 days (~1.3 years), including two juveniles resighted after 641 and 649 days (~1.7 years), still using the nursery. Visually estimated (n=34) disc widths (DW) of juveniles using the nursery site ranged from 150-240 cm (mean +/- SD: 199 +/- 19), and the DW of two juveniles measured using drones were 218 and 219 cm. Five juveniles were tracked using GPS-enabled satellite transmitters for 12-69 days (mean +/- SD: 37 +/- 22) in 2015 and 2017, and nine juveniles were tracked using passive acoustic transmitters for 69-439 days (mean +/- SD: 182 +/- 109) from May 2019-September 2021. Satellite-tracked individuals exhibited restricted movements within Wayag lagoon. The minimum core activity space (50% Utilisation Distribution-UD) estimated for these five individuals ranged from 1.1-181.8 km(2) and the extent of activity space (95% UD) between 5.3-1,195.4 km(2) in area. All acoustically tagged individuals displayed high residency within the nursery area, with no acoustic detections recorded outside the lagoon in the broader Raja Ampat region. These juveniles were detected by receivers in the lagoon throughout the 24 h diel cycle, with more detections recorded at night and different patterns of spatial use of the lagoon between day and night. The observed long-term residency of juvenile M. alfredi provides further compelling evidence that the Wayag lagoon is an important nursery area for this globally vulnerable species. These important findings have been used to underpin the formulation of management strategies to specifically protect the Wayag lagoon, which will be instrumental for the survival and recovery of M. alfredi populations in Raja Ampat region.","[Setyawan, Edy; Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Erdmann, Mark V.] Univ Auckland, Conservat Int Aotearoa, Auckland, New Zealand; [Mambrasar, Ronald; Hasan, Abdi W.] Birds Head Seascape Program, Konservasi Indonesia, Sorong, Indonesia; [Sianipar, Abraham B.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Vet & Life Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Auckland, New Zealand; [Stevenson, Ben C.] Univ Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland, New Zealand; [Jaine, Fabrice R.

A comprehensive array of acoustic receivers was deployed at two near-shore coastal sites in south-eastern Australia, to examine the movements, activity-space size and residency of a temperate rocky-reef, herbivorous species Girella elevata. Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure. The results from the present study will further contribute to the spatial information required in the zoning of effective marine protected areas, and our understanding of temperate reef fish ecology.","[Stocks, Jerom R.; Gray, Charles A.; Taylor, Matthew D.] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Stocks, Jerom R.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Batemans Bay Fisheries Ctr, Batemans Bay, NSW 2536, Australia; [Taylor, Matthew D.] NSW Dept Primary Ind, Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, Nelson Bay, NSW 2316, Australia; [Gray, Charles A.] WildFish Res, Sydney, NSW 2232, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW; Department of Primary Industries & Regional Development NSW,"Stocks, JR (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",jerom.stocks@dpi.nsw.gov.au,"Taylor, Matthew/IRZ-9539-2023; Stocks, Jerom/N-9315-2016","Gray, Charles/0000-0001-9939-9995; Stocks, Jerom/0000-0001-6425-8869",Integrated Marine Observing System; Australian Animal Tagging and Monitoring System; NSW Saltwater Recreational Fishing Trust; Fisheries NSW; University of NSW,Integrated Marine Observing System; Australian Animal Tagging and Monitoring System; NSW Saltwater Recreational Fishing Trust; Fisheries NSW; University of NSW,"We thank personnel from the University of New South Wales and Fisheries NSW who provided technical advice, including Dylan Van der Meulen and Nicholas Payne.

Among the Indo-Pacific Scarus species, Scarus ovifrons is unique, being largely restricted to the warm temperate waters of Japan. Nonetheless, there is very little information available on the feeding ecology of this species. In this study, the authors used acoustic telemetry to detect the diel vertical movement patterns of S. ovifrons, video survey to detect its feeding depths and substrata and focal follow survey and genetic analysis to identify algae composition on the feeding scars at Kashiwajima Island, southwestern Japan (32 degrees 46 ' N, 132 degrees 38 ' E). Acoustic telemetry revealed that S. ovifrons spent most of its time in shallow water (<10 m) during the day and slept in deeper water (10-15 m) at night. Video and focal follow surveys revealed that most fishes of various sizes regularly took bites on epilithic algae and detrital materials on rocky substrata at depths of <10 m, but large fishes (>40 cm total length) sometimes took bites directly on live corals (Acropora solitaryensis) at the 5 m depth zone where live tabular corals dominated the benthos. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that epilithic algae collected from feeding scars were mainly composed of Rhodophyta, and coralline algae were less often targeted. Overall, this study revealed that S. ovifrons feeds mostly at depths <10 m, and the feeding algae substrata of the species are similar to those of tropical coral reef parrotfishes.","[Gomi, Kazuma; Nakamura, Yohei] Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Arts & Sci, Monobe 200, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan; [Nakamura, Yohei; Adachi, Masao] Kochi Univ, Fac Agr & Marine Sci, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan; [Kanda, Masaru] Kuroshio Zikkan Ctr, Otsuki, Japan; [Honda, Kentaro] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Fisheries Resources Inst, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Nakaoka, Masahiro] Hokkaido Univ, Field Sci Ctr Northern Biosphere, Akkeshi Marine Stn, Akkeshi, Japan; [Honma, Chiho; Adachi, Masao] Ehime Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan",Kochi University; Kochi University; Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Hokkaido University; Ehime University,"Nakamura, Y (corresponding author), Kochi Univ, Grad Sch Integrated Arts & Sci, Monobe 200, Nankoku, Kochi 7838502, Japan.",ynakamura@kochi-u.ac.jp,"kanda, masaru/LZG-3659-2025; Nakaoka, Masahiro/I-9237-2019","Nakamura, Yohei/0000-0002-2412-2139",,,,,68,8,8,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to infer movement patterns of seven adult C. latus within Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a no-take marine protected area (MPA) northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, a preliminary exploration of detections recorded outside of BIRNM was used to gain knowledge of the potential for larger scale movements. Ascertaining long-term movement patterns, including residency, mobility, and identifying core activity spaces can play a considerable role in how MPAs, like BIRNM, are adapted to meet the needs of mobile species.ResultsHigh residency index values were observed for individual C. latus within the BIRNM array (meanSE: 0.913 +/- 0.04, range 0.75-1.0) across the 17 months monitored. Most fish were also detected on receivers located outside BIRNM. An observed to expected detection ratio revealed that despite high residency, only 9.6% of expected transmissions were detected based on the average tag transmission rate. Network analysis revealed high individual connectivity with many of the receivers inside BIRNM and a large number of core use receivers (mean: 10.7, range 6-14) within individual networks.ConclusionsMost C. latus were present in BIRNM at least twice per day, but were overall detected below the expected rates, demonstrating mobility, large core activity spaces and wide use of the acoustic array inside BIRNM and greater St. Croix shelf. How residency is inferred from acoustic telemetry detections, and interpreted for species with variable mobility, has important considerations for spatial management planning and telemetry analyses. For MPA development to meet the spatial requirements of species with mixed resident-mobile spatial ecology, detailed long-term movement data are required. Assessing residency in MPAs using acoustic telemetry should be formalized and carefully interpreted based on specific species, environmental conditions, and array configuration.","[Novak, Ashleigh J.; Becker, Sarah L.; Finn, John T.; Danylchuk, Andy J.; Jordaan, Adrian] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Pollock, Clayton G.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI 00820 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service,"Novak, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Conservat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",novakjashleigh@gmail.com,"Jordaan, Adrian/GRF-1661-2022; Jordaan, Adrian/E-6962-2011","Jordaan, Adrian/0000-0001-9510-8011","National Park Service, Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-101-2-14]; University of Massachusetts Amherst","National Park Service, Puerto Rico Sea Grant; University of Massachusetts Amherst","Funding for this research was provided by the National Park Service, Puerto Rico Sea Grant (Project Number: R-101-2-14), and University of Massachusetts Amherst.",,46,21,24,0,5,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2050-3385,,ANIM BIOTELEM,Anim.

We analysed the vertical movements of silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus using pop-up archival tags deployed on 7 individuals in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean. The sharks changed depth predictably with water column thermal structure, moving deeper with seasonal increases in mixed layer depth while occupying a narrow ambient water temperature range around similar to 27 degrees C. At shorter timescales, higher resolution data from 5 tags showed that silvertip shark depth varied cyclically with surface light levels, increasing during daylight and on nights around the full moon. This matches the diel vertical migrations of many fish species, suggesting that the sharks' light-driven depth changes might relate to foraging. While most vertical movements (>98%) were within the mixed layer, deeper dives to 200-800 m occurred approximately every 3 d. High-resolution data from one recovered tag showed the shark ascending deep (>200 m) dives in 2 sharply defined phases, initially fast then slow. Analysis of dive profiles against dissolved oxygen (DO) data suggested that the shark may have ascended rapidly to escape low DO levels at depth, then reduced its ascent rate by 50-80% once DO levels increased. While a small sample, the electronic tags deployed in this study revealed the silvertip sharks' predictable use of mixed layer waters, narrow thermal range and apparent intolerance of hypoxic conditions.

In this work, we combined the analysis of multi-year landings and underwater visual census with acoustic telemetry to investigate the long-term movement patterns (up to 4 years) of almaco jack, Seriola rivoliana, a large reef top predator, in one protected and one unprotected offshore shallow seamount in the Azores, central North Atlantic. Although the analysis of visual census and landing data suggests a pronounced seasonal pattern of occurrence, we found that tagged fish were almost continuously detected at the seamounts for up to four consecutive years. Some individuals showed a few long periods of undetection of 1-2 months in the Formigas reserve, mostly in the fall and winter. Mobility within this seamount increased during spring and summer, and geostrophic current speed was negatively correlated with detection probability. Overall, the acoustic telemetry results showed that adult almaco jacks were resident year-round, refuting the traditional view that these fish are essentially migratory and a seasonal occurrence in the Azores. Given the intrinsic vulnerability of resident fish to fishing, our results highlight the importance of protecting these sites in order to preserve these mature fish aggregations with high reproductive potential.","[Fontes, Jorge; Schmiing, Mara; Afonso, Pedro] Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores,"Fontes, J (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Inst Marine Res, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Rua Prof Doutor Frederico Machado, P-9901862 Horta, Portugal.",fontes@uac.pt,"Afonso, Pedro/MFK-1866-2025; Fontes, Jorge/KDP-1808-2024; Afonso, Pedro/B-7815-2013","Schmiing, Mara/0000-0001-7556-217X; Fontes, Jorge/0000-0002-8451-5532; Afonso, Pedro/0000-0002-4618-2589","FCT/MEC; Azorean DRCTC (OE, FEDER/COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia); project MARMACII [INTEREG/05/MAC/4.2/A4]; project SEAMOV [PTDC/MAR/108232/2008]; project MoniZEC [DRCT/0281M2.1.2/I/018/2011]; FCT/MCTES program; DRCT Reequipamento program","FCT/MEC; Azorean DRCTC (OE, FEDER/COMPETE, Pro-Convergencia); project MARMACII; project SEAMOV; project MoniZEC; FCT/MCTES program; DRCT Reequipamento program","We thank T.

This study integrates acoustic telemetry and a GIs to quantify movement patterns of one such species, the ocean whitefish (Caulolatilus princeps) in a marine protected area. Seventeen ocean whitefish were tagged and actively tracked over multiple 24-h periods to measure fine-scale movement patterns. Home ranges based on 95% kernel utilization distributions averaged 20,439 +/- 28,492 (+/- S.D.) m(2). Fish were active during the day, foraging over sand habitat at depths averaging 21 +/- 8 m, but were inactive at night, taking refuge near rocky reefs at depths averaging 15 +/- 7 m. Seventeen additional fish were tagged with coded acoustic transmitters and passively tracked using automated underwater acoustic receivers for up to I year. Approximately 75% of these fish exhibited long-term (I year) fidelity to home ranges in the study area. Results suggest that MPAs can be an effective means of protecting populations of ocean whitefish and based on their habitat associations, ocean whitefish can be managed separately from other reef associated groundfishes.

The endangered giant triton snail Charonia tritonis is a natural predator of COTS, although aquarium and field observations indicate the intensity of direct predation may be inadequate to significantly mediate outbreaks. However, their mere presence can elicit a chemically induced sensory behavioural response which may suppress COTS populations when in non-outbreak status. While there is increasing knowledge of the sensory biology of both species, little is known regarding giant triton snail numbers on the GBR or about how they move and occupy space, making it difficult to determine their true zone of influence and thus their capacity to disrupt COTS behaviour. We used passive acoustic telemetry to establish short-term activity space and movement patterns of giant triton snails on the GBR. Individuals were tracked for up to 41 d, were observed to travel 234.24 m d(-1), with a mean total cumulative distance travelled at night (1923.19 m) nearly double that observed during the day (1014.84 m). These distances encompass those reported for COTS (10.3 m d(-1)) and align with COTS nocturnal behaviour. Space utilisation distributions (UDs) revealed a mean (+/- SD) home range of 1179.40 +/- 659.40 m(2) (95% UD) and a core area of 195.68 +/- 141.31 m(2) (50% UD). Revealing the short-term movement patterns of this natural COTS predator within a reef environment advances knowledge of its spatial ecology and will provide information for its future conservation and for COTS management efforts.","[Schlaff, Audrey; Menendez, Patricia; Hall, Michael; Heupel, Michelle; Armstrong, Thomas; Motti, Cherie] Australian Inst Marine Sci AIMS, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia; [Menendez, Patricia] Monash Univ, Dept Econometr & Business Stat, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle] Univ Tasmania, Integrated Marine Observing Syst, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Australian Institute of Marine Science; Monash University; University of Tasmania; Integrated Marine Observing System,"Motti, C (corresponding author), Australian Inst Marine Sci AIMS, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia.",c.motti@aims.gov.au,"Menéndez, Patricia/M-7719-2019; Motti, Cherie/A-2588-2012; Menendez, Patricia/D-8905-2013","Menendez, Patricia/0000-0003-0701-6315; Motti, Cherie/0000-0002-3292-2785; Schlaff, Audrey/0000-0002-2650-5969",Australian Federal Government Department of the Environment and Energy Reef 2050 Sustainability Plan Grant [3600000775],Australian Federal Government Department of the Environment and Energy Reef 2050 Sustainability Plan Grant,"This research was supported by the Australian Federal Government Department of the Environment and Energy Reef 2050 Sustainability Plan Grant ID: 3600000775.

We applied network theory to 4 years of acoustic telemetry data for grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) at Palmyra, an unfished atoll, to assess their potential role in nutrient dynamics throughout this remote ecosystem. We evaluated the dynamics of habitat connectivity and used network metrics to quantify shark-mediated nutrient distribution. Predator movements were consistent within year, but differed between years and by sex. Females used higher numbers of routes throughout the system, distributing nutrients over a larger proportion of the atoll. Extrapolations of tagged sharks to the population level suggest that prey consumption and subsequent egestion leads to the heterogeneous deposition of 94.5 kg d(-1) of nitrogen around the atoll, with approximately 86% of this probably derived from pelagic resources. These results suggest that sharks may contribute substantially to nutrient transfer from offshore waters to near-shore reefs, subsidies that are important for coral reef health.","[Williams, Jessica J.] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Silwood Pk Campus,Buckhurst Rd, Ascot SL5 7PY, Berks, England; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Jacoby, David M.

Acoustic telemetry was used to continuously track the movements and activity patterns of 10 harlequin fish (330-620mm total length; 0.5-3kg weight) for a 16-month period at a coastal reef site. Data showed that the harlequin fish is a site-attached, diurnal predator, with a relatively small home range in comparison with other temperate reef fishes from Australia and New Zealand. These characteristics indicate that the harlequin fish is susceptible to localised depletions from fishing, but that it can be protected within no-take marine protected areas and can be detected with appropriate daytime monitoring techniques.

In studies of an organism's functional ecology, key behavioural traits such as foraging periodicity are assumed to be uniform across the species. In particular, the fundamental division between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns is usually assumed to be a fixed one, with organisms demonstrating physiological traits optimised for a particular diel rhythm. 2. In this study, we explore the activity rhythm of a tropical reef fish, the golden-lined rabbitfish, Siganus lineatus. We make use of acoustic telemetry (manual tracking), combined with underwater observations of feeding behaviour to investigate the diel foraging patterns of S. lineatus, at three sites around the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef. 3. We found significant differences in the activity patterns of shoreline and reef-based populations of S. lineatus. Individuals inhabiting the boulder-shoreline site foraged during the day and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the two reef populations foraged only during nocturnal hours, remaining stationary at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish. 4. We suggest that S. lineatus is a diurnal nominal herbivore whose biological rhythm has developed the flexibility to be nocturnal. This development may simply represent the masking effects of predation, competition or ontogeny, or it may represent entrainment over an evolutionary time-scale necessary to enable the species to expand its range into the coral reef environment. 5. Either way, the results identify S. lineatus as a potential subject for research into the relative importance of the various biological forces driving divisions along the temporal niche axis and suggest that the species has the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at the ecological and evolutionary level.","[Fox, Rebecca J.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University,"Fox, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.fox@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011",,"Australian Research Council; Lizard Island Reef Research Foundation (LIDF); Australian Coral Reef Society; Vemco, a division of Amirix Pty Ltd","Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Lizard Island Reef Research Foundation (LIDF); Australian Coral Reef Society; Vemco, a division of Amirix Pty Ltd","We thank A.

Juveniles used a small (< 1 km(2)), shallow (1-2 m depth) embayment where three receivers recorded 60-80 % of total detections of tagged animals, although individuals of all species moved throughout the array and beyond the lagoon to the open reef slope. Detections at these primary sites were more frequent during winter and when water temperatures were highest during the day.

Often found in schools, Scarus rivulatus, is an abundant herbivorous species on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, especially on inshore reefs. Recent evidence has highlighted the limited spatial movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools). Each individual may therefore have little impact on the spatial resilience of coral reefs.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Bellwood, D.

Once relatively common throughout Florida and the Caribbean, the species; is now considered vulnerable (i.e., threatened with extinction) due to overfishing and loss of juvenile mangrove habitat. Goliath grouper in the southeastern US form annual spawning aggregations on high-relief reefs located offshore of both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida, US. To determine spawning site fidelity and describe migration patterns to aggregations, we implanted 50 adult goliath grouper with acoustic transmitter tags from 2010 to 2013. Fish were tagged at known spawning sites off the Florida Atlantic coast and tracked as they moved through the FACT Network array of acoustic receivers. From 2010 to 2020, we collected similar to 7 million detections from tagged goliath grouper at 153 sites along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. Results of this long-term tracking indicate that adult goliath grouper are relatively sedentary during non-spawning months (Nov to June) but move significantly more prior to, during, and immediately after spawning (July to Oct). Inter-annual spawning site fidelity was high: between 80-93% of tagged fish returned to the same spawning sites each year. Arrival timing at spawning sites coincided with the August new moon, with males arriving earlier than females. Some individuals migrated distances greater than 400-km per year, with observed migration rates of up to 44-km per day prior to spawning. Long-term tagging data are critical for understanding movement patterns and developing management strategies for this species of special conservation concern.","[Ellis, Robert D.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA; [Koenig, Christopher C.; Coleman, Felicia C.] Florida State Univ, Coastal & Marine Lab, 3618 Coastal Highway, St Theresa, FL 32358 USA; [Locascio, James V.] Mote Marine Lab, Sarasota, FL 34236 USA; [Malinowski, Christopher R.] Ocean First Inst, Key Largo, FL 33037 USA",Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission; State University System of Florida; Florida State University; Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium,"Ellis, RD (corresponding author), Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, 100 8th Ave SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA.",robert.ellis@myfwc.com; ckoenig@fsu.edu; locascio@mote.org; chris@oceanfirstinstitute.org; fcoleman@fsu.edu,"Coleman, Felicia/IAN-6791-2023","Coleman, Felicia/0000-0001-6286-9471; Ellis, Robert/0000-0001-7178-8980","This project would not have been possible without the vital advice and assistance of Captains Don Demaria and Mike Newman (F/V Dykoke).

Studying reef shark populations' spatial ecology also contributes important data for effective conservation planning. The purpose of this study was to define the home range of neonatal blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) around Moorea, French Polynesia, and compare estimates using both mark-recapture surveys and active acoustic telemetry. Mark-recapture surveys produced a minimum convex polygon (MCP) of 0.07 km(2) that was significantly larger than the MCP derived from acoustic telemetry (0.02 km(2)). Acoustic telemetry produced 50 and 95% kernel utilization densities that were smaller (0.02 km(2)) and larger (0.14 km(2)) than home range estimates from mark-recapture surveys, respectively. Home range estimates from this study are the smallest that have been documented for neonatal blacktip reef sharks, possibly owing to the study sites' proximity to deep channels.

Acoustic telemetry was used to investigate whether adult A. gouldii can be effectively protected within adequately sized no-take MPAs. Ten passive acoustic receivers tracked the movements of 15 A. gouldii individuals (69-112-cm total length; 7-31-kg weight) at a site off north-western Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Most of the fish displayed high site fidelity (91-100% residence time for 10 of the 11 fish with useful data) for a narrow strip of fringing coastal reef (similar to 1-km length by similar to 40-m width) throughout a 12-month period.

Comparison with other resident temperate-reef teleosts indicated no relationship between fish length and home-range area, and that A. gouldii has a relatively small home range.

Acoustic telemetry is arguably the most popular method used to study the movements of fish. Despite this method being able to elucidate many aspects of movement behavior, including residency, home range, and migration, among others, one aspect that remains challenging is the study and definition of connectivity, particularly within marine seascapes. As such, this review assesses published literature on acoustic telemetry studies, which have specifically assessed some aspect of fish connectivity, and discusses these in terms of study distribution and overall trends, the diversity of taxa and life stage assessed, the role that large-scale acoustic telemetry networks plays in assessing connectivity of marine fishes, how connectivity studies have been used in an applied context, and proposes definitions linked to specific types of connectivity, which will assist future researchers when conceptualizing studies. Further, methods that can be used in conjunction with acoustic telemetry to complement the data are discussed. Given that marine resources and habitats are intricately connected, this review highlights the critical role that acoustic telemetry can play in assessing this link. It is envisaged that our developed framework of connectivity definitions will assist future studies and stakeholders in assessing ecosystem functioning and ultimately contribute to improved conservation and management of marine fish populations and ecosystems.","[Welch, Rebecca J.; Childs, Amber-Robyn; Murray, Taryn S.; James, Nicola C.] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Private Bag 1015, Makhanda 6140, South Africa; [Childs, Amber-Robyn; Murray, Taryn S.] Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, Makhanda, South Africa; [Darnaude, Audrey M.] Univ Montpellier, MARBEC, CNRS, Ifremer,IRD, Montpellier, France; [James, Nicola C.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Inst Coastal & Marine Res, Gqeberha, South Africa",National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; Rhodes University; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Ifremer; Universite de Montpellier; Nelson Mandela University,"Welch, RJ (corresponding author), South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Private Bag 1015, Makhanda 6140, South Africa.",welchrebecca83@gmail.com,"James, Nicola/HTP-6378-2023; Darnaude, Audrey/D-1745-2014; Murray, Taryn/M-4252-2017","Murray, Taryn/0000-0003-2694-7588; James, Nicola/0000-0002-9472-5314; Childs, Amber-Robyn/0000-0003-4717-2646",South African National Research Foundation [221]; COST Action; COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology),South African National Research Foundation(National Research Foundation - South Africa); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"This article is based on the work from COST Action CA19107/Ocean Decade Action 221 Unifying Approaches to Marine Connectivity for Improved Resource Management for the Seas (SEA-UNICORN), supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology, ).",,140,1,1,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency (>0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth. Given that estuarine habitats face constant anthropogenic pressures, understanding partial migration and habitat connectivity of large coastal predators should be a priority for their management.","[Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario; Heupel, Michelle R.; Tobin, Andrew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Espinoza, Mario] James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, PMB 3, Townsville, Qld 4810, Australia",James Cook University; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science; James Cook University; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.;Espinoza, M (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Marine & Environm Sci, Australian Inst Marine Sci, AIMS JCU, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",marioespinozamen@gmail.com,"Espinoza, Mario/AAV-3460-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Heupel, Michelle/0000-0002-8245-7332",Australian Government [6.1]; Australian Research Council [FT100101004]; PADI Foundation; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences; Australian Endeavour; AIMS@JCU Scholarships; Australian Research Council [FT100101004] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,"Australian Government(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); PADI Foundation; College of Marine and Environmental Sciences; Australian Endeavour(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); AIMS@JCU Scholarships; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This project was funded by the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub Project 6.1).

Relative abundance was determined using 49 sightings transects (approximate to 1 km) distributed across the atoll and of all turtles encountered (n=68), 91% were immature (CCLmin <= 65 cm). Habitat type was significantly correlated with abundance, with more turtles encountered on the coral reef than in the lagoon (GzLMM, chi(2)(2)=6.85, p<0.05; CPUE reef=1.41 turtles h(-1), CPUE lagoon=0.62 turtles h(-1)). Hawksbills were also significantly more abundant within protected areas (GzLMM, chi(2)(1)=8.69, p<0.05; CPUE Blue Hole Natural Monument (BHNM) = 2.96 turtles person(-1) h(-1); CPUE Half Moon Caye Natural Monument (HMCNM)=2.34 turtles h(-1); outside boundaries=0.88 turtles h(-1)). Of 26 captures, 19 focal individuals were equipped with ultrasonic transmitters for active acoustic telemetry, and tracked for 6-25 days (n=10, 2009; n=9, 2010). Spatial habitat utilisation was found to be highly variable, with large areas of overlap between distinct home ranges. Home range averaged 31.2 ha +/- 32.6 (range 5.1-111.3 ha) for the juveniles that were successfully tracked (n=15), with maximum displacement in the order of 1.8 km +/- 1.0 (range 0.5-4.0 km) and net displacement at 1.2 km +/- 0.9. This offshore atoll constitutes an important developmental habitat for the regional population and although our tracking durations were limited, home range of juvenile hawksbills at this site is significantly more expansive than that documented elsewhere.

Movements of an important recreational target species from the Mediterranean Sea, the parrotfish Sparisoma cretense. were determined in a marine protected area using passive acoustic telemetry, to evaluate site fidelity and homing, quantify home range and identify temporal patterns. Six adult parrotfish (20.8-29.8 cm total length) were caught along the north-eastern coast of Lampedusa (Italy) and surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Three fish were caught and released at the same site within the integral (i.e. no entry-no take) reserve, whereas the others were caught outside the reserve boundary and released at the mid reserve 0.5 km apart. Two of the three fish that were released away from the capture site demonstrated homing abilities. Four fish showed a strong site fidelity, whereas the others moved frequently in and out of the monitoring area. Home range sizes estimated over the period of monitoring (up to 207 days) varied from 70,387 to 256,398 m(2), with core areas of 16,688 to 84,946 m(2). Home range size did not differ significantly between day and night. Home ranges of all fish extended beyond the reserve boundaries, showing example of potential spillover into take zones. Temporal activity patterns of fish were diurnal with a dominant diel rhythm, likely due to a resting behaviour at night. Though not specifically designed to protect exploited fish, the marine reserve of Lampedusa seems adequate for the conservation and management of S. cretense. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Those species responsible for maintaining functional connectivity between habitats are often called mobile links and are regarded as essential elements of resilience. By providing connectivity, they support resilience across spatial scales. Most marine organisms, including fishes, have long-term, biogeographic-scale connectivity through larval movement. Although most reef species are highly site attached after larval settlement, some taxa may also be able to provide rapid, reef-scale connectivity as adults. On coral reefs, the identity of such taxa and the extent of their mobility are not yet known. We use acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of Kyphosus vaigiensis, one of the few reef fishes that feeds on adult brown macroalgae. Unlike other benthic herbivorous fish species, it also exhibits large-scale (> 2 km) movements. Individual K. vaigiensis cover, on average, a 2.5 km length of reef (11 km maximum) each day. These large-scale movements suggest that this species may act as a mobile link, providing functional connectivity, should the need arise, and helping to support functional processes across habitats and spatial scales. An analysis of published studies of home ranges in reef fishes found a consistent relationship between home range size and body length. K. vaigiensis is the sole herbivore to depart significantly from the expected home range-body size relationship, with home range sizes more comparable to exceptionally mobile large pelagic predators rather than other reef herbivores. While the large-scale movements of K. vaigiensis reveal its potential capacity to enhance resilience over large areas, it also emphasizes the potential limitations of small marine reserves to protect some herbivore populations.","[Welsh, J.

Between August 2010 and September 2012, we used acoustic telemetry to continuously monitor movements of 31 Lutjanus argentiventris (yellow snapper) and 25 Mycteroperca rosacea (leopard grouper) at Los Islotes, a small no-take reserve and reported spawning site for both species in the SW Gulf of California. Though the majority of fish from both species exhibited moderate levels of site fidelity to Los Islotes (snapper: present 49 +/- 30% of days since tagging, grouper: 64 +/- 30%), cluster analyses revealed multiple patterns of site fidelity within species. Approximately 30% of snapper exhibited decreases in site fidelity during the spawning season, and snapper did not spawn at the reserve during the study. Grouper spawning aggregations at Los Islotes were visually observed in 2011 and 2012, though the abundance of fish and the intensity of courtship behaviors were reduced in comparison with reported aggregations elsewhere in the Gulf. Three snapper and 2 grouper made repeated movements across pelagic waters between Los Islotes and Marisla Seamount, another documented aggregation site in the SW Gulf. The demonstrated variation in movements of these species over multiple temporal and spatial scales warrants consideration of movement patterns in assessments of reserve performance, as well as the combination of traditional fisheries regulations (e.g. size limits) with marine reserves throughout the Gulf.","[TinHan, Thomas; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA; [Erisman, Brad; Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Div Marine Biol Res, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Weaver, Amy; Vazquez-Arce, Daniel] Sociedad Hist Nat Niparaja AC, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California San Diego; Scripps Institution of Oceanography,"TinHan, T (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90815 USA.",t.tinhan@gmail.com,"Erisman, Brad/P-1640-2019","Aburto-Oropeza, Octavio/0000-0002-8173-1432; TinHan, Thomas/0000-0002-5610-7718",Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation; California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture [DGOPA-05356-140710-3457],Walton Family Foundation; David and Lucile Packard Foundation(The David & Lucile Packard Foundation); California State University (CSU) Long Beach College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; CSU COAST; AAUS Kevin Gurr Scholarship; SCTC Marine Biology Foundation; National Commissions of Fisheries and Aquaculture,"We thank 3 anonymous reviewers for their help in improving the manuscript.

Eleven mature female Deacon Rockfish were tagged and monitored during an 11-month period, at a nearshore rocky reef off Seal Rock, Oregon, USA, an area of recurring seasonal hypoxia (defined as dissolved oxygen concentration [DO] < 2 mg l(-1)). Two tags were detected leaving the study area by day 35, indicating predation or emigration. Three tags became inactive within the array, indicating tag loss or fish death. Six resident fish inhabited the array for 246-326 days. Resident fish exhibited high site fidelity, small home ranges (mean 95% KDE = 4907 m(2)), and consistent activity patterns for the duration of the summertime high-resolution array (5 months), except during seasonal hypoxia. Resident fish were strongly diurnal in summer, with high levels of daytime activity above the bottom in relatively rugose habitat, followed by nighttime rest periods in deeper, less rugose habitat. During summertime hypoxia, resident fish exhibited less daytime activity during daytime hours with no rest periods at night, inhabited shallower water depths, and moved well away from their core activity areas on long, erratic forays. During the winter, diel patterns were less evident with higher activity levels at night (than in the summer) and lower activity levels in the day (than in the summer). We propose that some Deacon Rockfish continuously inhabit nearshore reefs throughout the year, but that daily/seasonal movement patterns, seasonally occurring hypoxia, and prey preferences for planktonic organisms influence relocation.","[Rasmuson, Leif K.; Blume, Mathew T.

Quantifying home range is critical for conservation, and can enable the use of concepts such as 'umbrella species', whose conservation protects other species due to shared habitat. To determine the value of the humphead wrasse as an umbrella species for coral reef conservation, we conducted a multi-year study of humphead wrasse home range at Palmyra Atoll, Central Tropical Pacific, tagging juvenile, female, and male individuals with acoustic transmitters. We quantified home range using 2 metrics, length and area, and determined if these metrics were related to the sex and maturity status of the individual. We recorded individual movements during 5030 fish days, yielding detailed records for 14 individuals comprising 3 juveniles, 5 females, and 6 males. The home range of humphead wrasse measured over a 2 yr study was 0.4 to 14 km and changed with ontogeny. Females had larger home ranges than other reef fishes studied to date (n = 68), indicating value as an umbrella species for coral reefs. We compared the home range of the species to the size distribution of tropical marine protected areas (MPAs), and used a model to estimate the MPA length necessary to retain humphead wrasse. Most MPAs are too small to effectively protect the humphead wrasse.","[Weng, Kevin C.] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA; [Pedersen, Martin W.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, DK-2920 Charlottenlund, Denmark; [Del Raye, Gen A.; Gray, Andrew E.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Pelag Fisheries Res Program, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",William & Mary; Virginia Institute of Marine Science; Technical University of Denmark; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Weng, KC (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, Coll William & Mary, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",kevinweng@vims.edu,"Gray, Andrew/LCU-3798-2024; Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/C-4709-2013","Weng, Kevin Chi-Ming/0000-0002-7069-7152","NOAA's Undersea Research Program; Coral Reef Conservation Program; Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory [NA05OAR4301108, NA09OAR43002]; Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR) [NA09OAR4320075]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA09OAR4320075]",NOAA's Undersea Research Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Coral Reef Conservation Program; Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory; Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Research at Palmyra Atoll was funded by a grant to K.C.W. from NOAA's Undersea Research Program and Coral Reef Conservation Program, and the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory pursuant to Project Number NA05OAR4301108 and NA09OAR43002.

Between 2008 and 2011, galvanised timed releases were trialled in both static field tests and on blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus, cowtail Pastinachus atrus, and porcupine Urogymnus asperrimus rays in Coral Bay (-23A degrees 08'41aEuro(3), 113A degrees 45'53aEuro(3)), Western Australia. The timed releases remained attached to animals for the duration required for tracking and in four out of five deployments transmitters were recovered after release from the animals. The use of modified Rototags for sharks and stainless steel darts for stingrays allowed rapid and effective attachment to animals, with limited impact on their welfare in the short term. External attachment for short-term tracking of coral reef-associated elasmobranchs should be considered as a complementary option to internal placement of transmitters in animals either by surgery or by ingestion.","[Speed, Conrad W.; O'Shea, Owen R.; Meekan, Mark G.] UWA Oceans Inst M096, Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [O'Shea, Owen R.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Perth, WA 6150, Australia",University of Western Australia; Australian Institute of Marine Science; Murdoch University,"Speed, CW (corresponding author), UWA Oceans Inst M096, Australian Inst Marine Sci, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",conrad.speed@gmail.com,"Speed, Conrad/F-2913-2015","Speed, Conrad/0000-0003-3186-8710; Meekan, Mark/0000-0002-3067-9427",Australian Institute of Marine Science; Murdoch University,Australian Institute of Marine Science; Murdoch University,"Funded by the Australian Institute of Marine Science and Murdoch University.

Interindividual variability was detected for both spatial and temporal patterns. There were 2 principal movement behaviours that were recorded, with some individuals showing high site fidelity and others showing a more mobile behaviour, moving out from the monitoring area. Observation-area curves indicated that a period between 3 and 5 d was required to determine home ranges of the sedentary fish. Home range sizes were small, with a minimum shift of core areas occurring on a daily basis. Total minimum convex polygon (MCP) areas ranged between 0.102 and 0.671 km(2), whereas 95 % kernel utilization distributions (KUD) ranged between 0.760 and 1.333 km(2). Core areas (50% KUD) ranged between 0.175 and 0.294 km(2). There were no significant differences in home range patterns between day and night periods. However, the use of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) revealed diel rhythms on the detection pattern that could be related to a resting behaviour at night. Estimation of home ranges of S. scriba agrees with the sedentary habits of the Serranidae family and suggests the potential use of MPAs for the sustainable development of the fishery of this small Serranid.","[March, D.; Palmer, M.; Alos, J.; Cardona, F.] UIB CSIC, IMEDEA, Esporles 07190, Islas Baleares, Spain; [Grau, A.] LIMIA, Port Dandratx 07157, Islas Baleares, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); ATTITUS Educacao; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"March, D (corresponding author), UIB CSIC, IMEDEA, Miquel Marques 21, Esporles 07190, Islas Baleares, Spain.",david.march@uib.es,"Palmer, Miquel/E-3561-2013; March, David/G-6489-2014","Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539; Miquel, Palmer/0000-0002-7875-3673; March, David/0000-0002-6118-761X; Grau, Amalia/0000-0002-6461-6985","Sonotronics Inc; Spanish Ministry of Research and Science [CTM2005-00283, BES-2006-13252]; Government of the Balearic Islands",Sonotronics Inc; Spanish Ministry of Research and Science(Spanish Government); Government of the Balearic Islands,"We thank the many people that collaborated in this project, particularly A.M.

Concern over fishing of Chrysophrys auratus spawning aggregations in embayments near a west Australian city led to an annual 4-month spatial fishing closure. However, the extent to which it protects fish migrating to and from aggregations is unclear. Acoustic telemetry demonstrated a bimodal pattern of entry to and departure from the main embayment via only one of several pathways. Among years, 33%-56% of fish occurred in the pathway prior to the closure, but most left before it ceased. Fish were detected within the closure in multiple but not always consecutive years. Variation in migration timing and aggregation philopatry may alter capture risk, but pre- and postspawning migratory fish are fished in the main pathway and adjacent reefs, which would presumably impact spawning aggregation biomass. Assessment of this would assist in understanding whether expansion of the closure's spatial and temporal limits is necessary to ensure spawning biomass or whether current management is sufficient.","[Crisafulli, B.

These fish are susceptible to pressure-related injuries (i.e., barotrauma) during fishing that compromise survival after catch and release. Barotrauma-afflicted fish may not only experience immediate mortality but also delayed mortality after returning to depth. This variability and unknown fate leads to uncertainty in stock assessment models and rebuilding plans. To generate better estimates of immediate and delayed mortality and postrelease behavior, Red Snapper were tagged with ultrasonic acoustic transmitters fitted with acceleration and depth sensors. Unique behavior profiles were generated for each fish using these sensor data that allowed the classification of survival and delayed mortality events. Using this information, we compared the survival of Red Snapper released using venting, nonventing, and descending treatments over three seasons and two depths. Red Snapper survival was highest at cooler temperatures and shallower depths. Fish released using venting and descender tools had similar survival, and both these groups of fish had higher survival than nonvented surface-released fish. Overall, Red Snapper had 72% survival, 15% immediate mortality, and 13% delayed mortality, and all fish suffering from delayed mortality perished within a 72-h period after release. Results from these field studies enhance the understanding of the delayed mortality and postrelease fate of Red Snapper regulatory discards. Moreover, these data support the practice of using venting or descender devices to increase the survival of discarded Red Snapper in the recreational fishery and show that acoustic telemetry can be a valuable tool in estimating delayed mortality.","[Curtis, Judson M.; Johnson, Matthew W.; Stunz, Gregory W.] Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA; [Diamond, Sandra L.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Biol, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Diamond, Sandra L.] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Sci & Hlth, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [Johnson, Matthew W.] Bur Ocean Energy Management, 1201 Elmwood Pk Blvd, New Orleans, LA 70123 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Western Sydney University,"Curtis, JM (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Harte Res Inst Gulf Mexico Studies, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",judd.curtis@tamucc.edu,"Johnson, Matthew/AAA-3299-2020",,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries Initiative [NA10NMF4330126],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Marine Fisheries Initiative(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"We thank the many people that contributed to this study: members of the Fisheries and Ocean Health Lab at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies; M.

Few studies have provided direct evidence of connectivity across seascapes, and the importance of benthic seascape structure on movement behavior is poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, we coupled hydro-acoustic technology to track fish with seafloor mapping and pattern analysis techniques from landscape ecology to quantify seascape structure. Bluestriped grunts Haemulon sciurus and schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus were tracked over 24 h periods using boat-based acoustic telemetry. Movement pathways, and day and night activity spaces were mapped using geographical information system (GIS) tools, and seafloor structure within activity spaces was mapped from high-resolution aerial photography and quantified using spatial pattern metrics. For both fish species, night activity spaces were significantly larger than day activity spaces. Fish exhibited a daytime preference for seascapes with aggregate coral reef and colonized bedrock, then shifted to night activity spaces with lower-complexity soft sediment including sand, seagrass, and scattered coral/rock. Movement path complexity was negatively correlated with seascape complexity. This demonstrates direct connectivity across multiple patch types and represents the first study to apply quantitative landscape ecology techniques to examine the movement ecology of marine fish. The spatially explicit approach facilitates understanding to the linkages between biological processes and the heterogeneity of the landscape. Such studies are essential for identifying ecologically relevant spatial scales, delineating essential fish habitat and designing marine protected areas.","[Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Biogeog Branch, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Hitt, Steven; Pittman, Simon J.; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; University of the Virgin Islands,"Pittman, SJ (corresponding author), Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm Biogeog Branch, 1305 EW Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA.",simon.pittman@noaa.gov,,"Pittman, Simon/0000-0002-4113-6970",NOAA,NOAA(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),This research was supported by a NOAA cooperative agreement with the University of the Virgin Islands.

The precise estimation of home range size, as well as diel differences in home ranges, are essential when considering the appropriate size of an MPA. In addition, behavioral characteristics of spawning migration should also be considered for species that form spawning aggregations. Our aim was to clarify the diel variation in home range size and the degree of precision of the returning ability of white-streaked grouper Epinephelus onus by acoustic telemetry. Seventeen individuals were studied, and nighttime home range sizes that were calculated by 50 and 95% kernel utilization distributions were 5.9-fold and 5.5-fold greater, respectively, than the daytime home ranges. The average inter-center distance between home ranges during the 2 time periods ranged from 3.0 to 67.9 m (22.5 m on average), suggesting that the day-night home range shift within the home ground varied individually. Returning ability for 10 individuals that showed clear spawning migration behavior was also analyzed, and the average inter-center distance between home ranges during the periods before and after spawning was 8.1 m. Eight out of these 10 individuals showed precise returning after the spawning migration to the patchy coral substrates that were used before the spawning migration. The present study suggests that appropriate setting position of the home ground can establish long-term protection of the species due to their precise returning ability after the spawning migration.","[Nanami, Atsushi; Sato, Taku; Yamaguchi, Tomofumi] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Res Ctr Subtrop Fisheries, Fukai Ota 148, Ishigaki, Okinawa 9070451, Japan; [Mitamura, Hiromichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Informat, Dept Social Informat, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Mitamura, Hiromichi; Arai, Nobuaki] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Core Res Evolutionary Sci & Technol, Chiyoda Ku, Gobancho, Tokyo 1020076, Japan; [Sato, Taku] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Res Ctr Marine Invertebrates, Natl Res Inst Fisheries & Environm Inland Sea, Onomichi, Hiroshima 7220061, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Tomofumi; Kawabe, Ryo; Soyano, Kiyoshi] Nagasaki Univ, Inst East China Sea Res, Org Marine Sci & Technol, Taira machi 1551-7, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Yamamoto, Ken; Kawabata, Yuuki] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, 1-14 Bunkyo Machi, Nagasaki 8528521, Japan; [Arai, Nobuaki] Kyoto Univ, Educ & Res Ctr, Field Sci, Kyoto 6068501, Japan",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Kyoto University; Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA); Nagasaki University; Nagasaki University; Kyoto University,"Nanami, A (corresponding author), Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Seikai Natl Fisheries Res Inst, Res Ctr Subtrop Fisheries, Fukai Ota 148, Ishigaki, Okinawa 9070451, Japan.",nanami@fra.affrc.go.jp,"Kawabata, Yuuki/H-4109-2019","Kawabe, Ryo/0000-0002-4030-6667",,,,,55,7,8,0,25,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Acoustic monitoring studies indicate that olive rockfish are highly residential and that black rockfish are capable of long migrations and have less site fidelity; yet little is known about the long-term movements of blue rockfish. External tag-recapture studies indicate that blue rockfish may have intermediate movements relative to these congener nearshore species. To better understand the site fidelity, and daily and seasonal movements of blue rockfish over long (>1-year) time scales, we placed acoustic transmitters into 21 adult blue rockfish (30-41 cm total length) in Carmel Bay, California. Blue rockfish displayed intermediate movement patterns and residency relative to other similar kelp forest rockfish species. Two-thirds of tagged blue rockfish (13 fish) exhibited high residency to the study area (>12 mo). When in residence, mean home range of blue rockfish was 0.23 km(2), however as many as 30% of tagged blue rockfish shifted their core home range area during the study. Most shifts in home range occurred during upwelling season, and tagged fish moved up to 3.1 km when in residence. Blue rockfish with short residence times were last detected in the study area in late winter and early spring. Blue rockfish were observed at shallower depths during day than night, likely indicative of diurnal feeding. However, over longer time scales, blue rockfish were detected at deeper depths during upwelling periods and with increased wave heights.

In this study, passive telemetry and fine-scale habitat data were integrated for the first time to investigate the relevance of community fishery reserves (CFRs) for managing reef fish resources. In Efate Island (Vanuatu), 38 thumbprint emperors Lethrinus harak (Lethrinidae) were tagged at 7 sites and tracked between April 2011 and February 2012 using an acoustic array of 16 receivers. The survey area extended over 11.3 km(2) of fringing reef in 3 coastal community tenures that included 3 small CFRs. Habitats were mapped using very high resolution satellite imagery and ground-truthing. Thirty fish were detected for up to 229 d (median = 153 d). Six geographical groups were identified among 21 resident fish. These groups showed strong fidelity to small sites (116 to 763 m) that were located in reserves and fished areas, across community tenures, and across 12 habitat types. Overall, 42 excursions were detected at several hundreds to thousands of meters from the fidelity sites along contiguous fringing reefs, across habitat types, and across boundaries of CFRs and community tenures. The estimated home range size of L. harak ranged from 116 to 3979 m (median: 763 m) and was highly varied within fish groups. We concluded that home range size and behavioral plasticity of L. harak limit the effectiveness of small individual CFRs for protecting this species. Networks of CFRs would be more effective but require management arrangements between neighbor communities.","[Leopold, Marc; Gabriault, H.; Andrefouet, S.; Dumas, P.] Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia; [Leopold, Marc; Ham, J.; Raubani, J.; Dumas, P.] Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu; [Chateau, O.; Gabriault, H.] Aquarium Lagons, Lab Marine Biol & Ecol, Noumea 98807, New Caledonia",Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Léopold, M (corresponding author), Univ Reunion, UMR ENTROPIE, IRD, CNRS, Noumea 98848, New Caledonia.;Léopold, M (corresponding author), Fisheries Dept Vanuatu, Port Vila, Vanuatu.",marc.leopold@ird.fr,,"Dumas, Pascal/0000-0001-7369-8989",French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Pacific Fund; Government of New Caledonia; Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department),"This study was funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Pacific Fund, the Government of New Caledonia, and the Government of Vanuatu (Fisheries Department).

From 1984 to 2016, a total of 3 430 C. nasutus (178-980 mm fork length) were tagged (with small plastic dart tags) throughout the species' distributional range, with an overall reported recapture rate of 7.2%. Recaptured individuals displayed high levels of residency, moving an average of 14.8 km, with time-at-liberty ranging from 0 to 6 809 days. The majority of recaptures (84.6%) were made within 1 km of the tagging sites; however, some large-scale movements, of up to 528 km, were recorded. Although C. nasutus individuals moving greater distances were characterised by greater mean sizes (mm fork length) at time of recapture, the distances moved by juveniles were not significantly different from those of adults (p > 0.05). Low levels of connectivity among coastal regions were therefore expected due to the high degree of residency displayed by this species. Combining traditional management approaches together with a well-designed network of no-take marine protected areas is likely to be the most effective way to protect this vulnerable species. A lack of data on the movements of adults remains a challenge, but this could be overcome by tracking large individuals tagged with long-life acoustic transmitters.","[Murray, T. S.; Cowley, P.

In coral reefs, pelagic nutrient subsidies are believed to play an increasingly important role under ongoing and projected environmental changes. Here, we combine visual sightings with passive acoustic monitoring to report habitat use and behaviour by cetaceans within atoll lagoons in the Maldives and Chagos archipelagoes. We demonstrate that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are the most widely distributed and numerically abundant cetacean inside these atolls (>90% of all individual cetaceans by numbers). Our visual and acoustic observations both provide evidence of a regular diurnal behaviour, where dolphins enter the lagoons during the morning, for day-time resting, and exit during the afternoon, for night-time foraging offshore. Using standard metabolic models and timing of lagoonal residencies, we estimate that a dolphin pod would deposit approximately 288 +/- 17 kg year(-1) of nitrogen of primarily mesopelagic origin inside the lagoons. The nitrogen deposited inside an atoll lagoon by a dolphin pod resident year-round will therefore likely enhance coral reef productivity and resilience and suggests that these dolphins play a role in making pelagic energy and nutrients available to coral reefs. The absence of any acoustic detections following the reversal of the monsoon winds suggests that the short-to-medium-term residency of the dolphins is sensitive to seasonal productivity dynamics.","[Letessier, T.

Here, we identify seasonal changes in fish chorusing activity using passive acoustic monitoring, in the central Red Sea mesophotic and adjacent shallow coral reef zones. For this study, recorders were placed in the mesophotic coral reef zone (70-80 m), and adjacent shallow reef sites (10 m), over 2 weeks during summer and winter seasons. A total of eleven choruses were identified and catalogued according to timing, location and acoustic characteristics of frequency and sound pressure levels. The presence of choruses in both deep and shallow reef sites is indicative of critical habitat for fish foraging, courtship, spawning, and/or migratory activity. All but two choruses were found to originate at or near the mesophotic sites. Four choruses unique to summer and winter (n=3 and 1 respectively) were most prevalent in soundscapes. Temperature and oxygen levels, measured to document conditions under which the choruses were present, showed little change across the mesophotic zone even between seasons, while daily fluctuation occurred in the adjacent shallow sites in both seasons.","[Havlik, Michelle-Nicole; Parry, Anieka J.; Steckbauer, Alexandra; Watts, Marta Ezeta; Marchese, Fabio; Benzoni, Francesca; Duarte, Carlos M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Marine Sci Program, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div BESE, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Havlik, MN (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Marine Sci Program, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div BESE, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.",michellenicole.havlik@kaust.edu.sa,,,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology10.13039/501100004052,King Abdullah University of Science and Technology10.13039/501100004052(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology),"We thank the CMR staff, especially Andres Espinoza, Ramzi S.

Four commercial fish species (Epinephelus maculatus, Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus microrhinos, and Scarus ghobban) were studied for 17 months (45 fish). Nine fish (20%) were detected on reefs other than the reef onto which they were released. Four patterns of inter-reef movement were identified during the survey, including home range relocations, movements larger than the scale of the study, many inter-reef movements within the study area, and punctual excursions outside the daily home range. The information gathered in this study demonstrates the ability of the fish to carry out medium-scale movements in a fragmented habitat. Consequently, the effectiveness of the reserve to protect the entire population is probably limited for these species. Because all the identified patterns implied at least one movement across the reserve boundaries, our results support the hypothesis that the Laregnere Marine Reserve, part of the South Lagoon Marine Park, could benefit the adjacent fished area through spillover.","[Chateau, Olivier; Wantiez, Laurent] LIVE Univ New Caledonia, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia",,"Wantiez, L (corresponding author), LIVE Univ New Caledonia, BP R4, Noumea 98851, New Caledonia.",wantiez@univ-nc.nc,"Wantiez, Laurent/L-3343-2013","Wantiez, Laurent/0000-0001-5024-2057",,,,,32,56,68,3,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1054-3139,1095-9289,,ICES J MAR SCI,ICES J.

However, fine-scale movements and use of artificial reefs by red snapper over diel periods is unclear. Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550-745 mm TL; n = 12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100 m, with 75% of locations within 30 m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean = 27.5 m, SD = 7.1) than day (mean = 19.1 m, SD = 8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332-958d based on passive acoustic monitoring. The close proximity of these fish to the reef over 24-h periods and the long-term residency provides evidence that these artificial reefs are important habitat for red snapper and should be considered an effective management tool.

Relative to the total amount of available habitat, kelp bass showed a habitat selection preference for rock boulder, rock rubble and kelp habitat. These habitats offer high vertical relief, shade and large holes for shelter, and may attract and facilitate prey capture. Average home range size was 3 % of the area of the reserve. Only 1 of 12 tracked fish crossed the reserve boundary, but this accounted for less than 5 % of the fish's time.

Transmitter-tagged sharks were monitored from November 2012 to July 2019. Residency comparisons were based on the percentage of days that an individual was present in the study area for each month. Sandbar Sharks had greater residencies in fall than spring and winter, Bull Sharks had greater residencies in summer, and Nurse Sharks had greater residencies in the fall. No seasonal patterns were detected for Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks, but one individual returned to the study area in all 5 years that the transmitter was active. One Sandbar Shark and one Nurse Shark had long-term preferences (>3 years) for specific sites. Long-distance migrations (n = 7) away from the artificial reef area in the northern Gulf of Mexico were observed for three Sandbar Sharks (588, 589, and 1,894 km), two Bull Sharks (927 and 968 km), and two Nurse Sharks (903 and 943 km), with six of these migrating sharks returning to their tagging areas. Specifically, two Bull Sharks and two Nurse Sharks made winter migrations to the southern end of Florida (Florida Keys), and two Sandbar Sharks migrated to the middle of the west coast of Florida. A third Sandbar Shark made the longest distance migration and moved out of the Gulf of Mexico, into the Atlantic Ocean, and up to the South Carolina coast. Importantly, this Sandbar Shark returned to the same artificial reef where it was tagged and released in the northern Gulf of Mexico after its 3,788-km round trip migration. These long-distance migrations and subsequent homing behaviors, coupled with local residencies, indicate that the artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico may have significance extending well beyond the localized areas of reef deployment.","[Altobelli, Ashley N.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA",Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Szedlmayer, ST (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA.",szedlst@auburn.edu,,,Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Sportfish Restoration Fund,Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Sportfish Restoration Fund,"We thank R.

Four omnidirectional hydrophones were deployed for 7 months in the mooring area of Laregnere marine reserve (New Caledonia). The hydrophone network covered 50 ha. The monitored fish was caught in the study site and surgically implanted with an ultrasonic transmitter. The fish displayed a regular diurnal rhythm during 25 days before leaving the area. Different patterns of spatial use were identified. The temporal succession of these patterns indicates that the minimum distance covered by the fish every day ranged between 20 and 200 m. Its home range was at least 5 ha. A decrease of the detection was observed before the departure of the fish. This decrease coincided with the beginning of the reproduction period in New Caledonia and supports the hypothesis of a fish departure for the reproductive event. Despite the survey of only one specimen, the home range and movement calculated using acoustic telemetry are different in scale than the reported scuba-based visual estimations.

Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) offer a useful mechanism to protect these species and their roles in coral reef ecosystems. The effectiveness of MPAs notably relies on compliance together with sufficient size to encompass animal home range. Here, we measured home range of 147 grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, using acoustic telemetry in New Caledonia. The distribution of home range was then compared to local MPA sizes. We report a home range of 12 km(2) of reef for the species with strong differences between adult males (21 km(2)), adult females (4.4 km(2)) and juveniles (6.2 km(2) for males, 2.7 km(2) for females). Whereas local historic MPA size seemed adequate to protect reef shark home range in general, these were clearly too small when considering adult males only, which is consistent with the reported failure of MPAs to protect sharks in New Caledonia. Fortunately, the recent implementation of several orders of magnitude larger MPAs in New Caledonia and abroad show that recent Indo-Pacific MPAs are now sufficiently large to protect the home ranges of this species, including males, across its geographical range. However, protection efforts are concentrated in a few regions and cannot provide adequate protection at a global scale.","[Bonnin, Lucas; Boussarie, Germain; Vigliola, Laurent] IRD Inst Rech Dev, Ctr Noumea, Lab Excellence Labex Corail, UMR IRD UR CNRS ENTROPIE, BP A5, Noumea 98800, New Caledonia; [Bonnin, Lucas; Mouillot, David; Boussarie, Germain; Dagorn, Laurent] Univ Montpellier, IRD, IFREMER, MARBEC,CNRS, Montpellier, France; [Mouillot, David] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Wildlife Marine, Perth, WA 6020, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Curtin Univ, Dept Environm & Agr, Perth, WA 6102, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Robbins, William D.] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Marine Sci Program, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia; [Kiszka, Jeremy J.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA",Ifremer; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Universite de Montpellier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); James Cook University; Curtin University; University of Technology Sydney; State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Bonnin, L (corresponding author), IRD Inst Rech Dev, Ctr Noumea, Lab Excellence Labex Corail, UMR IRD UR CNRS ENTROPIE, BP A5, Noumea 98800, New Caledonia.;Bonnin, L (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, IRD, IFREMER, MARBEC,CNRS, Montpellier, France.",lucasbonnin@hotmail.fr,"Kiszka, Jeremy/AAH-2588-2020; Mouillot, David/HCH-5670-2022; Dagorn, Laurent/K-1002-2016; Vigliola, Laurent/J-7107-2016","Kiszka, Jeremy/0000-0003-1095-8979; Vigliola, Laurent/0000-0003-4715-7470; Boussarie, Germain/0000-0002-0809-1555",Fondation Total; Pew Charitable Trusts and Gouvernement de Nouvelle Caledonie,Fondation Total; Pew Charitable Trusts and Gouvernement de Nouvelle Caledonie,"Funding was provided by Fondation Total, Pew Charitable Trusts and Gouvernement de Nouvelle Caledonie.",,80,12,13,1,18,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUL 9,2021,11,1,,,,,,,14221,10.1038/s41598-021-93426-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-93426-y,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,TK9QY,34244536,"Green Accepted, Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2025-05-02,WOS:000674491000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We examined activity levels and behavioral patterns of red snapper over natural reefs, oil platforms and submerged ships. Telemetry tags (Sonotronics model Am) that transmitted tri-axial acceleration range, with average depth or average temperature were developed specifically to monitor red snapper and tested in captive fish. Wild red snapper were surgically implanted at depth and monitored for 16 months over artificial and natural reefs. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0-0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had significant effects on ODBA and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to differing feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily influence red snapper and that they behave differently on specific habitat types at certain times. Future efforts to examine the ecological performance of red snapper across reef types should therefore carefully take environmental influences into account.","[Getz, Ethan T.; Kline, Richard J.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Sch Earth Environm & Marine Sci, Brownsville, TX USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Kline, RJ (corresponding author), One West Univ Blvd, Brownsville, TX 78520 USA.",richard.kline@utrgv.edu,,"Kline, Richard/0000-0002-4116-2060","Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Artificial Reef Program, USA [475342]","Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Artificial Reef Program, USA","We thank Marlin Gregor and Sonotronics Inc. for assistance and expertise in the design and programming of the telemetry tags used in this study.

We predicted horn sharks would use an area restricted search (ARS) movement strategy to locate dense resource patches while minimizing energetic costs of travel and nighttime activity. As ectotherms, we predicted environmental temperature would play a significant role in driving movement and activity patterns. Methods Continuous active acoustic tracking methods and acceleration data loggers were used to quantify the diel fine-scale spatial movements and activity patterns of horn sharks. First passage time was used to identify the scale and locations of patches indicative of ARS. Activity was assessed using overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as a proxy for energy expenditure. Behavior within a patch was characterized into three activity patterns: resting, episodic burst activity, and moderate, consistent activity. Results After resting in daytime shelters, individuals travelled to multiple reefs throughout the night, traversing through depths of 2-112 m and temperatures of 10.0-23.8 degrees C. All sharks exhibited area restricted search patch use and arrived at their first patch approximately 3.4 +/- 2.2 h (mean +/- SD) after sunset. Sharks exhibited moderate, consistent activity in 54% of the patches used, episodic burst activity in 33%, and few (13%) were identified as resting at night. ODBA peaked while sharks were swimming through relatively deeper (similar to 30 m), colder channels when traversing from one patch to the next. There was no consistent pattern between ODBA and temperature. Conclusions We provide one of the largest fine-scale, high-resolution paired data sets for an elasmobranch movement ecology study. Horn sharks exhibited ARS movement patterns for various activity patterns. Individuals likely travel to reefs known to have profitable and predictable patches, potentially tolerating less suitable environmental temperatures. We demonstrate how gathering high-resolution information on the movement decisions of a community resident enhances knowledge of community structure and overall ecosystem function.","[Meese, Emily N.; Lowe, Christopher G.] CSULB Shark Lab, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Meese, Emily N.] Texas A&M Univ, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77551 USA",Texas A&M University System,"Meese, EN (corresponding author), CSULB Shark Lab, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.;Meese, EN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77551 USA.",emily.n.meese@gmail.com,,"Meese, Emily/0000-0003-4928-4297",USC Wrigley Graduate Fellowship; Donald R.

We used a 300 km long passive acoustic telemetry network to measure site fidelity and dispersal distances of adult red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), and spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) tagged within two estuarine no-take zones at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. Seventy-eight tagged fish were tracked an average of 549 days with some individuals followed for over four years. Fish spent most of their total time at liberty inside no-take zones with a mean residency of 125-178 consecutive days after release, and 67%-95% of their total time, depending on species. Sixty-four individuals (82%) also utilized adjacent public waters, dispersing up to 650 km, although dispersal rates averaged less than 0.10 km day(-1) for all three species. Red drum and black drum movements across reserve boundaries were clearly bi-directional with individuals averaging 4 and 30 excursions per year, respectively, into fished areas. Both species spent more time outside reserve boundaries during their reproductive periods, suggesting that these no-take zones protect individuals that subsequently spawn over a wider geographic area. Our findings demonstrate that coastal marine reserves have the potential to provide substantial protection for highly mobile non-reef fishes. They further suggest that reserves designed to safeguard fish during non-reproductive periods may be most practical for estuarine species whose home ranges increase during spawning seasons.

The use of acoustic monitoring and network analysis can improve our understanding of the spatial ecology and functional connectivity of reef-associated species, providing a useful approach for reef-based conservation planning. This study compared and contrasted the movement and connectivity of sharks with different degrees of reef association. We examined the residency, dispersal, degree of reef connectivity, and MPA use of grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), silvertip (C. albimarginatus), and bull (C. leucas) sharks monitored in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus were detected most days at or near their tagging reef. However, while C. amblyrhynchos spent 80% of monitoring days in the array, C. albimarginatus was only detected 50% of the time. Despite both species moving similar distances (<50 km), a large portion of the population of C. albimarginatus (71%) was detected on multiple reefs and moved more frequently between reefs and management zones than C. amblyrhynchos. Carcharhinus leucas was detected less than 20% of the time within the tagging array, and 42% of the population undertook long-range migrations to other arrays in the GBR. Networks derived for C. leucas were larger and more complex than those for C. amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus. Our findings suggest that protecting specific reefs based on prior knowledge (e.g., healthier reefs with high fish biomass) and increasing the level of protection to include nearby, closely spaced reef habitats (<20 km) may perform better for species like C. albimarginatus than having either a single or a network of isolated MPAs. This design would also provide protection for larger male C. amblyrhynchos, which tend to disperse more and use larger areas than females. For wide-ranging sharks like C. leucas, a combination of spatial planning and other alternative measures is critical. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic monitoring can serve as a useful platform for designing more effective MPA networks for reef predators displaying a range of movement patterns.","[Espinoza, Mario; Ledee, Elodie J.

If individuals inside reserves behave differently to those outside, this information should be incorporated into reserve design and in management efforts to avoid the selective removal of certain behaviors. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, north-eastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types. One group had uni-modal home ranges that on average encompassed c.900 m linear distance. All nine residential snapper from the reserve displayed this behavior, as well as five of ten residential fish from the non-reserve area. The second group (five fish, all from the non-reserve area) had home ranges with two separate modes (bi-modal home ranges), which on average encompassed c.2 100 m linear distance. We suggest that some aspect of the marine reserve environment encourages extreme residency by either the modification of individual behaviors or through the removal of selective exploitation. If true this suggests that reserves and populations of exploited animals may become dependent on the life history characteristics of the individuals they encourage or select for.

However, it has been poorly studied and little is known about its spatial ecology, particularly about long-range travels. In this study, we investigated the residency and movement patterns of silvertip sharks in a widespread remote archipelago offshore the Pacific coast of Mexico, the Revillagigedo Archipelago. An array of 10 VR2W receivers was deployed around the archipelago to monitor the movement of 45 silvertip sharks during 11 years. Among the 40 sharks detected during the study, 34 exhibited high site fidelity with 70% of their daily detections recorded in one particular site. Residency index ranged from 0.049 to 0.99 with an average residency of 0.49 +/- 0.27 (SD). The sharks exhibited strong diurnal patterns in horizontal and vertical movements with two peaks of detections at sunrise and sunset and a presence in deeper waters during daytime. Eleven individuals (7 adult females) traveled from one island to another (separated by distances ranging from 60 to 425 km). Geographical ontogenetic segregation was observed within the archipelago with juveniles being present only around San Benedicto and Socorro islands. Five sharks tagged as juveniles left their tagging island once they had reached adulthood, three males between 8 and 10 years old and two females at 11 years old.","[Beauvais, Sarah M.

The spatial and temporal dimensions of fish behavior (movement and/or vertical migrations) are particularly relevant for rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) because most rockfish species are long-lived and have high site fidelity, increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation. In this study, we describe the short-term (with a tracking period of up to 46 d) spatial behavior, as determined by acoustic tracking, of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, a species subject to overexploitation in the Yellow Sea of China. The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) in the study area was 0.92 +/- 0.13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. Acoustic tracking also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area. However, the diel detection periodicity (24 h) was only evident for certain periods of the tracking time, as revealed by a continuous wavelet transform. The habitat selection index of tagged S. schlegelii suggested that S. schlegelii preferred natural reefs, mixed sand/artificial reef bottoms and mixed bottoms of boulder, cobble, gravel and artificial reefs. The preference of this species for the artificial reefs that were recently deployed in the study area suggests that artificial seascapes may be effective management tools to attract individuals. The vertical movement of tagged S. schlegelii was mostly characterized by bottom dwelling behavior, and there was high individual variability in the vertical migration pattern. Our results have important implications for S. schlegelii catchability, the implementation of marine protected areas, and the identification of key species habitats, and our study provides novel information for future studies on the sustainability of this important marine resource in eastern China.","[Zhang, Yingqiu; Xu, Qiang; Liu, Hui; Xu, Qinzeng; Yang, Hongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yingqiu; Liu, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Alos, Josep] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Biol & Ecol Fishes, Berlin, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Oceanology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur Gewasserokologie und Binnenfischerei (IGB)","Xu, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Oceanol, Key Lab Marine Ecol & Environm Sci, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",xuqiangcas@126.com; hshyang@qdio.ac.cn,"Liu, Huibiao/H-3208-2011","Alos, Josep/0000-0003-4385-9539","Ministry of Sciences and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2011BAD13B02]; State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China [201205023, 201305043]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA11020404]; Marie Curie Post-Doc grant (FP7-PEOPLE-IEF) [327160]","Ministry of Sciences and Technology of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Marie Curie Post-Doc grant (FP7-PEOPLE-IEF)(European Union (EU))","HY was supported through the National Key Technology Research and Development Program (grant no. 2011BAD13B02) provided by Ministry of Sciences and Technology of the People's Republic of China (URL: http://www.most.gov.cn/eng/), the Non-Profit Marine Sector (grant no. 201205023, 201305043) provided by State Oceanic Administration People's Republic of China (URL: http://www.soa.gov.cn/english/) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

Although many applications of PAM have been developed in recent years, it has never been used to identify a calling marine species. The south pass of Fakarava Atoll, French Polynesia, hosts spawning events of many reef fish species, including the camouflage grouper Epinephelus polyphekadion, with a spawning aggregation abundance exceeding 17 000 individuals during the full moons of June and July. The current study aimed to use PAM to distinguish camouflage grouper sounds among the vocal activities of all fish recorded during the aggregation periods. Audio recordings analysis resulted in the identification of 29 sound types, some of which showed diel and lunar patterns. Temporal analysis of these sounds in relation to spawning activities allowed the identification of camouflage grouper calls. These calls can be described as a single pulse or a series of 'boom(s)' with a pulse duration of similar to 44 ms and a low dominant frequency of 103 +/- 31 Hz. Video recordings show that the camouflage grouper produces the 'booms' to initialize spawner ascent and to promote synchronous gamete release into the water column. The study highlights for the first time that PAM can be used to identify the previously unknown sound of a fish species. Moreover, we can use it to understand the phenology of some biological activities for improving the resolution of fish biodiversity assessments.","[Jublier, Noemie; Bertucci, Frederic; Kever, Loic; Colleye, Orphal; Parmentier, Eric] Univ Liege, Lab Morphol Fonct & Evolut, Inst Chim, Batiment B6c Allee Six Aout 11, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Bertucci, Frederic; Lecchini, David] Univ Paris Sci & Lettres, EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR3278 CRIOBE, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Ballesta, Laurent] Andromede Oceanol, Carnon Plage, France; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI USA; [Lecchini, David] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Perpignan, France; [Rhodes, Kevin L.] Pacific Marine Sci & Conservat, Grass Valley, CA USA",University of Liege; Universite PSL; Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (EPHE); University of the Virgin Islands,"Parmentier, E (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Lab Morphol Fonct & Evolut, Inst Chim, Batiment B6c Allee Six Aout 11, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.",parmentier@uliege.be,"Frédéric, Bertucci/JTS-5586-2023; Parmentier, Eric/P-9733-2018","Jublier, Noemie/0000-0003-2143-6156; Parmentier, Eric/0000-0002-0391-7530; Bertucci, Frederic/0000-0002-2425-9362","Contrat de Projet Etat-Polynesie francaise 2015-2020, LabEx Corail - project Etape, PSL -project Ecora; National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research [NSF-1355437]; University of Liege; Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS) [J.0150.16]","Contrat de Projet Etat-Polynesie francaise 2015-2020, LabEx Corail - project Etape, PSL -project Ecora; National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research; University of Liege(University of Liege); Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS)(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS)","Contrat de Projet Etat-Polynesie francaise 2015-2020, LabEx Corail - project Etape, PSL -project Ecora); the National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, Grant/Award Number: VI-EPSCoR, NSF-1355437; University of Liege and by the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS-FNRS), Grant/Award Number: J.0150.16)",,81,9,10,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

A negative relationship between detection frequency and activity (rate of movement) was found for S. pulcher moving within the array. Most fish exhibited high site fidelity to the general area of the reserve, with 13 of the 16 fish detected spending an average of 99 +/- 2% of their total days at liberty in the study area, with a mean of 90 +/- 9% of total residence time spent within a 600 m core area. However, these fish showed some variability in area use between months, exhibiting periods of expansion in their range. Fish also tended to increase activity as seasonal water temperature increased. These expanded movements resulted in some fish crossing the reserve boundary for extended periods or leaving the reserve permanently.","Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Topping, DT (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",dtopping13@hotmail.com,,,,,,,42,66,87,0,34,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In May 2015-2017, divers located and surveyed a spawning aggregation site within Cabo Pulmo National Park. Adult M. jordani conformed to a lek mating system in which large males formed territories over sand adjacent to a rocky reef that were spatially segregated from smaller females outside of courtship and spawning periods. Females moved into male territories during evening hours to spawn. Male courtship behaviours targeted a single female, included head shakes and burst rises and preceded pair spawning prior to sunset. Males and females displayed three shared colour phases, but four phases were sex-specific. During evening hours, courtship and spawning, both sexes exhibited sexual dichromatism concurrent with reproductive behaviours. The pair-spawning mating system and observations of bimodal size distributions by sex support previous claims of protogyny in the species. Males produced sounds during territorial patrols, courtship and spawning rushes, which corroborated the importance of acoustic communication within the behavioural repertoire associated with spawning. Long-term acoustic monitoring revealed increases in total sounds detected day(-1) from March through June with diel increases (e.g., evenings) that may be indicative of the spawning season.

Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the movements of a large coral reef top predator (Aprion virescens, Lutjanidae; Hawaiian name 'uku') at five atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument (NWHIMNM) from May 2005 to September 2006. The study atolls were located between 23.8 degrees N, 166.2 degrees W and 28.5 degrees N, 178.3 degrees W, and were separated from their nearest receiver-equipped neighbor by distances ranging from 100 to 478 km. No inter-atoll movements by uku were detected but individuals were seasonally site-attached to core activity areas of up to 12 km in length, and ranged up to 19 km across atolls. Within their core areas, tagged uku exhibited diel and tidal habitat shifts, with the latter resulting in round trips of up to 24 km in 24 h. Seasonal uku migrations resulted in extended winter (October-April) absences from summer (May-September) core activity areas and may be linked to summer spawning. Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries. However, this would still require relatively large MPAs (12 km in length) to contain uku short-term (diel and tidal) movements, and seasonal migrations would still take uku beyond the boundaries of MPAs of this size. These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Edmonson Hall, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, PO Box 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,50,65,78,0,39,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

However, the extent to which these benefits occur is dependent on movement patterns of fish, for which there is a paucity of data, particularly for coral reef species. Eleven adult Kyphosus sectatrix were tracked [five in the Grand Caille marine reserve (MR) and six in the Petit Piton MR within the Soufriere Marine Management Area, St Lucia] from February to April 1999, using acoustic telemetry. Average number of days over which fish were tracked was 21.5 (range 5-51). Home range size of individuals, temporal use of space within the home range, and permeability of MR and habitat boundaries to fish movement were examined. Average minimum home range area of K. sectatrix was not significantly different between Grand Caille (30 514 m(2)) and Petit Piton (39 114 m(2)). However, the shape of home ranges was conspicuously different between the sites and reflected available reef shape, Individual home ranges overlapped strongly with those of other individuals at the same site, and use of space within the home range was generally restricted to a small number of preferred sites. Preferred sites were often shared among individuals and tended to be occupied at a specific time of day, with some sites were preferred in the morning and or afternoon, whilst others preferred during the middle of the day. Fidelity to a single sleeping-shelter site was high at night. MR boundaries over contiguous reef at Grand Caille were frequently crossed with individuals spending, on average, 63% of their time (range 37-94) outside the MR. This demonstrates the need for the MR boundary at this site to be implemented farther offshore to encompass the reef, if the MR is to better protect K sectatrix. At Petit Piton, where MR boundaries effectively encompass available reef, K sectatrix spent, on average, only 11% of their time (range 0-40) outside the protected area. At Grand Caille boundaries were crossed more readily (individuals spent an average of 18% of their time off reef) than at Petit Piton where individuals spent an average of 0.7% of their time off reef.

We used acoustic telemetry to quantify the movements of giant trevally, a large coral reef top predator, at 5 atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. We did not observe any inter-atoll movements but found that giant trevally were attached to core activity areas from which they made periodic atoll-wide excursions of up to 29 km. Within the core areas, the tagged fish exhibited diel habitat shifts. We identified Rapture Reef at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll as a spawning site, where giant trevally form seasonal mating aggregations. Giant trevally that use Rapture Reef as their core daytime area live there year-round, whereas those that occupy other areas of FFS migrate to Rapture Reef in the summertime during specific phases of the moon. Although giant trevally were wide-ranging and would require large marine protected areas (e.g. entire atolls or islands) to protect their entire range, core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally could be contained within relatively small marine protected areas. Identification of spawning sites could assist in the establishment of focused marine protected areas that, while quite small in size, could have significant impact in preserving the spawning biomass of this species. Very large marine protected areas are not feasible in most heavily populated areas, hence effective alternative management strategies must be found for this tishery-targeted, wide-ranging top predator. We suggest using a combination of relatively small marine protected areas, to protect core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally, and conventional measures such as minimum size or 'slot' limits to further safeguard spawning stocks.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Zool, Honolulu, HI USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Meyer, CG (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Holland, Kim/ABH-1490-2021","Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,40,125,143,1,60,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Due to its large size and complex life history characteristics, it is vulnerable to overfishing and has undergone substantial population declines in parts of its range. Knowledge of the species' movement ecology is currently limited to only 2 previous studies, and very little is known about populations in the western Indian Ocean. The present study aimed to use passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the importance of a remote coral reef to a population of humphead wrasse in the Republic of Seychelles, and subsequently assess the efficacy of a proposed marine protected area at this location for protection of the species. Tagged fish (n = 20) exhibited persistent (> 500 d) site fidelity, with low dispersal distances (mean +/- SD: 6.44 +/- 4.0 km) and restricted core activity spaces (50% Brownian bridge kernel utilization density: 0.91 +/- 0.61 km(2)). Additionally, the study site was home to a group of large (total length 97.9 +/- 20.6 cm) and currently unexploited humphead wrasse that showed longterm predictable site fidelity and thus could be vulnerable to over-exploitation. The establishment of a proposed no-take marine protected area at the study site would encompass the core home range area of all tagged humphead wrasse and could effectively conserve this stronghold of Endangered fish to ensure the persistence of the species in Seychelles waters.","[Daly, Ryan; Peel, Lauren R.; Gordon, Luke; Lea, James S.

This study investigates area utilisation and activity patterns of 13 adult roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae) using telemetry and underwater observations. Acoustic transmitters implanted into C. laticeps in tanks had no apparent effects on growth and mobility. Natural behaviour of the treated fish in the field was verified by SCUBA divers. Manual boat- and diver-based tracking was carried out inside the Castle Rock MPA, False Bay, South Africa, over a 17-month period. A radio acoustic positioning system (VRAP, VEMCO Ltd) was used to record automatically fish positions over two 1-month periods during and after the spawning season of roman. Manually recorded fish positions and VRAP positions inside the triangle of buoys within the system were accurate within 10m; deviations increased with increased distance of the fish from the centre of the system and during unfavourable sea conditions. Analysis of movement data using a 95% fixed kernel algorithm suggests that roman occupy small home ranges of between 1 000m(2) and 3 000m(2), which shows that this species is well suited for protection in small MPAs. Interestingly, the home range size did not seem to be related to fish size or habitat quality. Swimming activity decreased at night. During periods of cold-water upwelling, fish retreated into caves. During the spawning season, females extended their home ranges, which result in a 'spill over' effect of adult fish into fishing areas.","Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa; Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Kerwath, SE (corresponding author), Dept Environm Affairs & Tourism, Marine & Coastal Management, Private Bag X2, ZA-8012 Cape Town, South Africa.",skerwath@deat.gov.za,"Sauer, Warwick/GJI-2267-2022","Sauer, Warwick/0000-0002-9756-1757; Attwood, Colin/0000-0002-1045-3439; Kerwath, Sven/0000-0003-2751-5015",,,,,40,35,38,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1814-232X,1814-2338,,AFR J MAR SCI,Afr.

Coral reefs are no exception. However, there is a paucity of information relating to the performance of acoustic receivers on coral reefs. Our results suggest that the detection performance of acoustic receivers may be significantly impacted by the unique nature of the reef environment. This study assessed the performance of passive acoustic receivers on a typical inner-shelf fringing reef, Orpheus Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The detection range and diel performance variability of acoustic receivers was assessed using two parallel lines of 5 VR2W receivers spanning 125 m, deployed on the reef base and reef crest. Two 9-mm acoustic transmitters were moored at opposite ends of each receiver line. The working detection range for receivers was found to be approximately 90 m for the transmitter moored on the reef base and just 60 m for the transmitter moored on the reef crest. However, the detection range on the reef crest increased to 90 m when just the reef crest receivers were considered, highlighting importance of optimal receiver deployment. No diel patterns in receiver performance or detection capacities were detected, suggesting that no corrections are required when interpreting nocturnal versus diurnal activity patterns. We suggest that studies aiming for complete coverage of a site within a reef environment will require receivers in close (< 100 m) proximity, and that the placement depth of receivers must be a major consideration, with shallow receivers exhibiting a greater detection range than those on the reef slope. Our results highlight the challenges imposed by coral reefs for acoustic telemetry and the importance of receiver placement for studies conducted within these habitats.","[Welsh, J. Q.; Fox, R.

Because of the predictability of annual aggregations, giant sea bass (GSB) were fished throughout the twentieth century until they were nearly extirpated from southern California and Baja California, Mexico. To assess population recovery, acoustic telemetry was used to quantify spatiotemporal rhythmicity of GSB aggregations at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. Thirty-two individuals were tracked for 498 days over two consecutive spawning seasons in 2017-2018 and visual surveys were conducted monthly to estimate aggregation sizes. Aggregation behavior was documented from June-October and spawning most likely occurred at a pinnacle promontory from July-September. GSB exhibited residency to specific sites throughout the year and individuals showed fidelity to suspected spawning aggregation sites during the summer months. Ten (31%) GSB were detected at Santa Catalina Island year-round and 11 (34%) exhibited suspected annual spawning site fidelity. Four individuals (12%) were documented leaving the island during late fall/winter 2017 and returning in spring/early summer 2018, indicating partial seasonal migration and year-round fidelity to specific sites at Santa Catalina Island.

Wax-coated dummy transmitters (9 X 22 mm; 3.6 g) were surgically implanted into the gut cavity of four captive bluefin trevally. The fish retained the dummy transmitters for 17-22 months, but at the end of the study transintestinal expulsion was in progress in one individual. Five bluefin trevally captured at Honokohau, Hawaii, were surgically implanted with long-life (1-year) coded transmitters and released. Their movements were monitored with the use of 27 underwater receivers deployed along a 115-km stretch of coastline. The five bluefin trevally were detected by the receivers over periods ranging from I to 173 d (mean, 60 d), and their movements spanned up to 10.2 km of coastline. Daily movements were consistent with those observed by previous short-term active tracking studies and consisted of crepuscular migrations of 1-2 km between separate daytime and nighttime habitats. These data suggest that passive monitoring of bluefin trevally movements for periods of up to 22 months is theoretically possible and that transmitter expulsion is not necessarily the cause of shorter detection periods.","Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA; Hawaii Dept Land & Nat Resources, Div Aquat Resources, Honolulu, HI 96813 USA",University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa,"Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346,Coconut Isl, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,,,,,,,14,30,34,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-8487,1548-8659,,T AM FISH SOC,Trans.

Ballan wrasse were year-round residents at the study site where they exhibited distinct, rhythmic, diel, tidal and seasonal patterns of behaviour, whereas rays were occasional visitors to Portelet Bay with no discernible pattern to their visits. Results indicate relatively small MPAs (<0.5 km(2)) that with suitable habitat could provide effective, long-term protection for ballan wrasse, but would likely be of little conservation benefit for rays.

Range test studies have been performed to determine what environmental factors may interfere with acoustic equipment efficiency. Many of these studies have been performed on shallow coral reef environments for a few days to weeks. This study examined environmental factors that influence detection variability on a mesophotic coral reef south of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands (-64.96 degrees, 18.19 degrees). Data from a stationary transmitter were examined against numerous environmental variables from June to September 2011. A generalized linear model was used to examine the daily detection proportion response to eight different environmental variables. Factors which had strong negative effects on detections received included when the current direction was flowing from receiver to transmitter, current speeds above 0.2 ms(-1), a strong temperature gradient between transmitter and receiver, and increased water temperature. Detections varied throughout the different time periods of the day with sunset and sunrise having significantly lower detections than day, and sunset having significantly lower detections than night. The results highlight the importance of conducting a long-term range test and will aid design of future passive acoustic telemetry studies on mesophotic coral reefs.","[Jossart, Jonathan; Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA; [Primack, Avram] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Stolz, Robert] Univ Virgin Isl, Coll Sci & Math, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA",University of the Virgin Islands; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of the Virgin Islands,"Jossart, J (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers Bay, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA.",jossart1@gmail.com,"Stolz, Robert/AAC-5267-2020",,Puerto Rico Sea Grant [R-31-1-06]; NOAA Saltonstall- Kennedy Program [NA09NMF4270068]; Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) [NSF-814417]; Guy Harvey Research Institute; Lana Vento Charitable Trust,Puerto Rico Sea Grant; NOAA Saltonstall- Kennedy Program(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA); Virgin Islands Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR); Guy Harvey Research Institute; Lana Vento Charitable Trust,"We thank Dr. Tyler Smith for providing longterm temperature and current data.

The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea, first documented in the Caribbean in 2002, has rapidly expanded its range, displacing native seagrasses, and overgrowing bare sand. The southern stingray (Hypanus americanus) uses shallow seagrass and sand habitats for foraging. This paper examined the impacts of the invasive seagrass, H. stipulacea, on southern stingray behavior, foraging and movement patterns using acoustic telemetry and visual observations. From 2015 to 2018, 15 southern stingrays (14 juveniles of unknown sex and 1 female) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored within an acoustic array in Brewers and Perseverance Bays, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. The residence time, rates of movement and activity spaces for 50% and 95% utilization distributions (UD) were calculated for day and night periods. Tagged southern stingrays were detected within the array on average for 260 d (range 11-801 d) and residency for all individuals averaged 53% over the monitoring period (1079 d). Mean rates of movement per individual ranged from 40 to 150 m h(-1), was lowest during the nighttime and were significantly higher during crepuscular periods. Activity spaces during day and night periods were nearly identical and averaged 0.05 km(2) and 0.25 km(2) for 50% and 95% UD, respectively. Distances between day and night 50% UD activity spaces was 148 m (range 8-409 m) and mean percent overlap was 38%. In addition to acoustic monitoring, benthic cover of available habitats and visual surveys of stingray behavior and habitat preferences were conducted along fixed transects. Monotypic stands of the invasive H. stipulacea seagrass represented 42% of benthic cover, followed by bare sand (27%), mixed patches of native and invasive seagrasses (23%) and the native Syringodium filiforme (7%). A habitat selection index (HSI) comparing the percent cover of available habitats and habitats occupied by stingrays found a strong preference for the native seagrass S. filiforme (HSI = 2.30) and bare sand (HSI = 1.79) compared to H. stipulacea (HSI = 0.70). Visual surveys also revealed that 50% of foraging stingrays were in S. filiforme, while 28% and 17% were foraging in H. stipulacea and bare sand, respectively. Our results are an important baseline for examining how further expansion of H. stipulacea may affect southern stingray movement patterns and foraging preferences.","[Legernes, Michele] Bellona Environm Fdn, Radhusgata 28, N-0513 Oslo, Norway; [Legernes, Michele] Marea, Ormsundveien 16, N-0198 Oslo, Norway; [Nemeth, Richard S.] Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers, US Virgin Isl, MD 00803 USA; [Legare, Bryan] Ctr Coastal Studies, Shark Ecol Program, 5 Holway Ave, Provincetown, MA 02657 USA",University of the Virgin Islands,"Nemeth, RS (corresponding author), Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine & Environm Studies, 2 John Brewers, US Virgin Isl, MD 00803 USA.",ricknemeth.usvi@gmail.com,,"Legare, Bryan/0000-0001-6791-0293",Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) (NSF) [1355437],Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) (NSF),"Funding provided by Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (VI-EPSCoR) Grant (NSF #1355437) .

Movement patterns of brassy chubs Kyphosus vaigiensis were investigated using passive acoustic telemetry methods along the coastline of Hawaii Island. Of particular interest, two individuals displayed unexpected trans-island movement throughout estuarine and coastal habitats, which respectively traveled 311 km and 37 km from their release site.

Thirty percent of the fish tagged were not detected after the first 6 d following release and were assumed to have died or to have immediately emigrated away from platforms. Degrees of site fidelity varied widely among individuals, among species, and between platforms. Of the most abundant species tagged (cabezon Scorpaenichthys marmoratus, vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus, widow rockfish Sebastes entomelas, copper rockfish Sebastes caurinus, and greenspotted rockfish Sebastes chlorostictus), widow rockfish showed a high probability of being detected at platforms over a 2-year period. Vermilion rockfish emigrated away from the shallower Platform Gilda (64 m) faster than vermilion rockfish tagged at the deeper Platform Grace (93 m). Ten tagged individuals (eight vermilion rockfish, one copper rockfish, and one lingcod Ophiodon elongatus) moved between platforms (range 5-15 km) and/or natural habitat, although a majority moved from a shallower platform to a deeper one. These movements further support evidence that (1) many reef-associated rockfishes make ontogenetic shifts to deeper water and (2) shallower platforms export fishes faster than deeper platforms. There was no indication of seasonal emigration, but there was evidence for seasonal differences in activity for vermilion rockfish, widow rockfish, and greenspotted rockfish. Observed movements of fishes between platforms and natural reef habitat indicate that they can navigate between these habitats and that platform habitat, despite having higher densities of conspecifics, may be of higher quality to some individuals than natural reefs.","[Lowe, Christopher G.; Anthony, Kim M.; Jarvis, Erica T.; Bellquist, Lyall F.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Love, Milton S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Lowe, CG (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, 1250 Bellflower Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA.",clowe@csulb.edu,"Mason, Erica/AAT-1377-2021","Mason, Erica/0000-0003-3366-157X; Bellquist, Lyall/0000-0003-1247-0483",Minerals Management Service [1435-01-04-CA-34196 OCS/MMS 2007-006]; California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program,Minerals Management Service; California Artificial Reef Enhancement Program,"We thank A.

The technology uses receivers to detect and record acoustic transmissions emitted from tags attached to an individual. Acoustic signal strength naturally attenuates over distance, but numerous environmental variables also affect the probability a tag is detected. Knowledge of receiver range is crucial for designing acoustic arrays and analyzing telemetry data. Here, we present a method for testing a relatively large-scale receiver array in a dynamic Caribbean coastal environment intended for long-term monitoring of multiple species. The U.S. Geological Survey and several academic institutions in collaboration with resource management at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), off the coast of St. Croix, recently deployed a 52 passive acoustic receiver array. We targeted 19 array-representative receivers for range-testing by submersing fixed delay interval range-testing tags at various distance intervals in each cardinal direction from a receiver for a minimum of an hour. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we estimated the probability of detection across the array and assessed the effect of water depth, habitat, wind, temperature, and time of day on the probability of detection. The predicted probability of detection across the entire array at 100m distance from a receiver was 58.2% (95% CI: 44.0-73.0%) and dropped to 26.0% (95% CI: 11.4-39.3%) 200m from a receiver indicating a somewhat constrained effective detection range. Detection probability varied across habitat classes with the greatest effective detection range occurring in homogenous sand substrate and the smallest in high rugosity reef. Predicted probability of detection across BIRNM highlights potential gaps in coverage using the current array as well as limitations of passive acoustic technology within a complex coral reef environment.","[Selby, Thomas H.; Fujisaki, Ikuko; Smith, Brian J.] Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, 3205 Coll Ave, Davie, FL 33314 USA; [Hart, Kristen M.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 3321 Coll Ave, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA; [Pollock, Clayton J.; Hillis-Starr, Zandy] Natl Pk Serv, Buck Isl Reef Natl Monument, St Croix, VI USA; [Lundgren, Ian] Naval Facil Engn Command, Pacific, 258 Makalapa Dr,Suite 100, Honolulu, HI 96860 USA; [Oli, Madan K.] Univ Florida, Dept Wildlife Ecol & Conservat, Newins Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; United States Department of the Interior; US National Park Service; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Selby, TH (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Ft Lauderdale Res & Educ Ctr, 3205 Coll Ave, Davie, FL 33314 USA.",tselby@ufl.edu,"Smith, Brian/AAV-7609-2020","Smith, Brian/0000-0002-0531-0492",USGS Natural Resource Protection Program (NRPP),USGS Natural Resource Protection Program (NRPP),We acknowledge the USGS Natural Resource Protection Program (NRPP) for funding.,,44,54,60,0,24,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2045-7758,,,ECOL EVOL,Ecol.

Effective conservation and management can facilitate population recoveries. However, these efforts depend on robust data on movement patterns and stock structure, which are lacking for many threatened species, including the Critically Endangered soupfin shark Galeorhinus galeus, a circumglobal coastal-pelagic species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we continuously tracked 34 mature female soupfin sharks, surgically implanted with coded acoustic transmitters, for 7 years via 337 underwater acoustic receivers stationed along the west coast of North America. These sharks and an additional six were also externally fitted with spaghetti identification tags. Our tagging site was a shallow rocky reef off La Jolla (San Diego County), California, USA, where adult females were observed to aggregate every summer. Tagged soupfin sharks were highly migratory along the west coast of North America, between Washington, USA and Baja California Sur, Mexico. However, every 3 years, they returned to waters off La Jolla, California, where they underwent gestation. This is the first conclusive evidence of triennial migration and philopatry ('home-loving') in any animal, which is apparently driven by this species' unusual triennial reproductive cycle. Females of other shark and ray species with triennial reproductive cycles are also likely to exhibit triennial cycles of migration and philopatry. At least six (15%) of our tagged soupfin sharks were killed in commercial gillnets in Mexico. Policy implications. Identifying multiennial migratory cycles in mature female sharks can reveal hidden stock structure in the form of discrete breeding cohorts, which are spatially and temporally segregated as they cycle through different reproductive phases. Accounting for this complexity may improve the performance of spatially structured stock assessment models, particularly when fishery removals are spatially heterogeneous, as well as inform the spatiotemporal design of fishery-independent surveys. In the United States, the soupfin shark is neither actively managed nor recognized as a Highly Migratory Species; however, given the highly migratory behaviour we report, this designation should be revisited by the US Pacific Fishery Management Council. Finally, given the extensive fishery removals in Mexico, any future management must be internationally cooperative.","[Nosal, Andrew P.] Univ San Diego, Dept Environm & Ocean Sci, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Nosal, Andrew P.; Cartamil, Daniel P.; Bellquist, Lyall F.; Blincow, Kayla M.; Semmens, Brice X.; Hastings, Philip A.] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, Marine Biol Res Div, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Ammann, Arnold J.] NOAA, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Ecol Div, Santa Cruz, CA USA; [Bellquist, Lyall F.] Nature Conservancy, San Francisco, CA USA; [Ben-Aderet, Noah J.] NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Fisheries Resources Div, La Jolla, CA USA; [Burns, Echelle S.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Chapman, Eric D.; Klimley, A.

We used acoustic telemetry to investigate movement patterns between bay nursery habitats and adult reef habitats by a common Caribbean fish (Lutjanus apodus). We hypothesized that juvenile fish residing in their nurseries increase their home range as they grow and eventually include coral reefs in their activity range before their permanent migration to this adult habitat. Tagged fish were detected by underwater receivers for a period up to 12 months and a clear diel pattern was visible with most detections occurring during nighttime. Bay-to-reef movements were undertaken by fish that were larger than fish that were only detected in the bay. Stable isotope values of fin tissue from fish that showed reef-ward movements were similar to those of fish remaining in the bay, indicating that these movements were likely exploratory behavior as opposed to repeated feeding excursions. Understanding cross-habitat ontogenetic movements is essential for identification of ecologically relevant spatial scales for management of coastal fish populations.","[Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Australian Rivers Inst Coasts & Estuaries, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Huijbers, Chantal M.] Griffith Univ, Sch Environm, Gold Coast, Qld 4222, Australia; [Huijbers, Chantal M.; Nagelkerken, Ivan] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Anim Ecol & Ecophysiol, Inst Water & Wetland Res, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Nagelkerken, Ivan] Univ Adelaide, Inst Environm, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Layman, Craig A.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Appl Ecol, David Clark Labs 127, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; North Carolina State University,"Nagelkerken, I (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Sch Biol Sci, DX 650 418, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",ivan.nagelkerken@adelaide.edu.au,"Huijbers, Chantal/J-5176-2014; Nagelkerken, Ivan/E-1093-2011","Huijbers, Chantal/0000-0001-5206-3415; Nagelkerken, Ivan/0000-0003-4499-3940",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI; U.S. National Science Foundation [0746164],Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through VIDI(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This study was financially supported by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) through a VIDI Grant to IN, as well as U.S. National Science Foundation Grant OCE #0746164 to CAL.

Sixteen eels were captured from the mangrove fringe in multiple bays on St. Croix, USVI, implanted with coded acoustic transmitters, and their movements were tracked for up to 11 months using an array of 37 stationary acoustic receivers. They exhibited high site fidelity in the bays during their residence, using the same general parts of individual bays and did not switch bays except for one individual. There was no relationship between eel size (mean TL = 83 cm, range = 54-126 cm) and home range size (mean area of 95% KUD = 5.8 ha +/- 0.7 SE). Most individuals were more frequently detected at night than during the day suggesting greater nocturnal activity. Several of the larger eels (mean TL = 93 cm +/- 5.9 SE) showed clear and permanent emigration tracks out of the mangrove estuary to coral reef habitats offshore. For some individuals, these habitat shifts were preceded by exploratory movements away from the eel's typical home range the night before emigration. All final emigration events took place nocturnally, happened during a single night, and occurred during months from December to May. Mean emigration speed was 3.4 km/h. This study is the first documentation of an ontogenetic habitat shift in moray eels, as well as the first determination of home range size for this species and their site fidelity in mangrove habitats.","[Kendall, Matthew S.; Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss; Monaco, Mark E.] NOAA, NOS, NCCOS, MSE,Biogeog Branch, 1305 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Siceloff, Laughlin; Winship, Arliss] CSS Inc, 10301 Democracy Lane,Suite 300, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Ruffo, Ashley] NOAA, ERT Inc, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 3013 Estate Golden Rock, Christiansted, VI 00820 USA","National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Ocean Service, NOAA; Consolidated Safety Services, Inc.

Despite this, it is only within the last decade that substantial research effort has been directed at these species. Research effort has increased in conjunction with the realization that reef shark populations have experienced significant declines throughout their distribution. However, trends in declines have been coupled with reports of high abundance in some areas providing confusion about what healthy reef shark populations should look like. Given that coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and productive habitats, but also are one of the most threatened by climate change due to the effects of rising temperature and declining pH, there is a need to understand reef sharks to better predict consequences for their populations. Studies of reef sharks also have the potential to provide insights into the functioning of their populations and ecosystems more broadly because of the spatially constrained nature of their distributions, and high water visibility in most locations. These aspects make studying reef shark populations integral to understanding coral reef ecosystem dynamics and resilience to pressures. This paper synthesizes a number of key questions about coral reef sharks based on our experience researching this group of species over the past decade. Key research gaps and critical questions include aspects of life history, population dynamics, ecology, behavior, physiology, energetics, and more. This synthesis also considers the methods used to date, and what new and emerging techniques may be available to improve our understanding of reef shark populations. The synthesis will highlight how even basic questions relating to reef shark population sizes, how large they should be, and what impacts do they have on reef ecosystems, remain either unanswered or highly controversial.","[Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Escuela Biol, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Green, Madeline E.] CSIRO, Natl Res Collect Australia, Australian Natl Fish Collect, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Green, Madeline E.] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia",Australian Institute of Marine Science; State University System of Florida; Florida International University; Universidad Costa Rica; Universidad Costa Rica; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Australian National Fish Collection; University of Tasmania; James Cook University,"Heupel, MR (corresponding author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",m.heupel@aims.gov.au,"Espinoza, Mario/AAV-3460-2020; Simpfendorfer, Colin/G-9681-2011","Green, Madeline Elizabeth/0000-0002-5037-2043; Papastamatiou, Yannis/0000-0002-6091-6841",,,,,154,39,39,1,55,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Concurrently, herbivorous fishes have been severely overfished in many locations worldwide, contributing to increases in macroalgal cover. We used a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary approach to test if higher biomass of herbivorous fishes inside a no-take marine reserve makes this area more resistant to invasive algal overgrowth. Over a two year time period, we (1) compared fish biomass and algal cover between two fished and one unfished patch reef in Hawai'i, (2) used acoustic telemetry to determine fidelity of herbivorous fishes to the unfished reef, and (3) used metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing to determine diet composition of herbivorous fishes. Herbivore fish biomass was significantly higher in the marine reserve compared to adjacent fished reefs, whereas invasive algal cover differed by species. Herbivorous fish movements were largely confined to the unfished patch reef where they were captured. Diet analysis indicated that the consumption of invasive algae varied among fish species, with a high prevalence of comparatively rare native algal species. Together these findings demonstrate that the contribution of herbivores to coral reef resilience, via resistance to invasive algae invasion, is complex and species-specific.","[Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia; [Stamoulis, Kostantinos A.; Friedlander, Alan M.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Friedlander, Alan M.] Natl Geog Soc, Washington, DC USA; [Meyer, Carl G.; Fernandez-Silva, Iria; Toonen, Robert J.] Univ Hawaii, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA; [Fernandez-Silva, Iria] Calif Acad Sci, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA",Curtin University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; National Geographic Society; University of Hawaii System; California Academy of Sciences,"Stamoulis, KA (corresponding author), Curtin Univ, Perth, WA, Australia.;Stamoulis, KA (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Fisheries Ecol Res Lab, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",kostanti@hawaii.edu,"Fernandez-Silva, Iria/AAA-8996-2020; Toonen, Rob/V-6230-2019","Stamoulis, Kostantinos/0000-0003-2688-4695","Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Overseas Researchers and two Marie Curie Actions of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under REA grant [302957, 600391]; Sea Grant award [NA09OAR4170197]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NA09OAR4170197]",Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Postdoctoral Fellowship for Overseas Researchers and two Marie Curie Actions of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) under REA grant(Marie Curie Actions); Sea Grant award; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"The authors would like to thank Cindy Hunter of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa for logistical support and the use of the UH Marine Biology program boat, Jason Jones of the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology for diving support and tank fills, Brian Neilson and his team of the Hawai'i State Division of Aquatic Resources for providing information and fieldwork assistance, and Stacy Bierwagen of James Cook University for her work on fecal dispersal.

Grazing by tropical herbivores contributes to maintaining resilient coral reefs and marine reserves are critical in conserving herbivores and the functional role they provide. Less is known, however, about the effects of marine reserves on herbivorous fish and their role on temperate reefs. This study evaluated the potential for marine reserves to enhance grazing by herbivores on temperate reefs in Jervis Bay Marine Park, Australia. First, the movement patterns of a dominant grazer, luderick Girella tricuspidata, were determined using acoustic telemetry to assess the potential effects of marine reserves on G. tricuspidata. Second, the size and abundance of G. tricuspidata and other grazers (rock blackfish Girella elevata and silver drummer Kyphosus sydneyanus) was quantified on shallow subtidal reefs inside and outside marine reserves using a diver operated stereo-video system. Finally, grazing rates were quantified inside and outside marine reserves using video cameras. Luderick G. tricuspidata exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs and was significantly larger and more abundant within marine reserves. Rock blackfish G. elevata was significantly more abundant in one of four marine reserves, although showed no difference in size between zones. Silver drummer K. sydneyanus was significantly larger in marine reserves, although not significantly more abundant. On shallow subtidal reefs, G. tricuspidata was the dominant grazer compared to other girellids and kyphosids, accounting for >97% of total algal bites (predominantly on algal turfs). Grazing rates were higher on average within marine reserves (although not significantly higher) and there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of G. tricuspidata and number of algal bites, indicating grazing intensity increased with abundance. The findings in this study demonstrate the clear potential for greater grazing by herbivores within temperate marine reserves.

Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support. On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well understood. Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community. Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an 'ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef. Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using network graph theory to analyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems.","[Fox, Rebecca J.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia",James Cook University; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies; James Cook University,"Fox, RJ (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",rebecca.fox@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bellwood, David/E-2497-2011",,IMOS' Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS) Facility; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies,IMOS' Australian Acoustic Tagging and Monitoring System (AATAMS) Facility; Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies(Australian Research Council),"We thank the staff of Orpheus Island Research Station for the provision of essential facilities; J.

Depending on body size, thermal tolerance, and ability to avoid predators, horn sharks may need to balance tradeoffs when selecting a quality shelter. This study quantified vertical daytime distributions via dive surveys and shelter fidelity via acoustic telemetry during June - August 2016 and June - November 2017 in a temperate rocky reef (33 & x2da;26' N, -118 & x2da;29' W). Immature individuals (< 58 cm TL) were found refuging in shallower (< 10 m), warmer habitats consisting of smaller crevices and overhangs, whereas mature individuals (> 58 cm TL) were found in deeper (> 10 m), cooler habitats sheltering in larger caves and rock ledges. The sizes and relative abundances of sharks varied between land-associated and offshore-isolated reefs, indicating habitat type may be a likely driver of ontogenetic shifts in shelter behavior. No sharks returned to their shelters in 2016 coinciding with the period of El Nino conditions (increased temperature, shifts in community assemblage), yet shelter fidelity was 47% in 2017 under non-El Nino conditions. By quantifying sheltering behavior in a residential mesopredator, this study provides a framework for understanding how environmental conditions influence horn shark behaviors and their potential impacts on their community.","[Meese, Emily N.; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, CSULB Shark Lab, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Meese, Emily N.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA",California State University System; California State University Long Beach; Texas A&M University System,"Meese, EN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",emily.n.meese@gmail.com,,"Meese, Emily/0000-0003-4928-4297",USC Wrigley Graduate Fellowship; Donald.

Displacement experiments involving 12 groupers (mean size 57.9 cm) from multiple capture sites resulted in a 67 % homing success. Upon release at displacement sites (0.5 to 2.6 km from the point of capture), most initial movements were small-scale and non-directional. Neither the tidal range nor time of day influenced the magnitude of these daily movements. Returns to the capture sites were sudden, occurring predominantly (88 %) on spring tide dates. Fish displaced at the spring tide returned to capture sites faster (8.6 d) than those displaced at the neap tide (14.3 d). Time taken to return to capture sites ranged from 4 to 19 d (mean 9.6 d) and was not correlated with distance of displacement. However, time taken for the fish to home was negatively correlated with tidal range at displacement. Home ranges established after homing (0.07 to 0.73 km(2)) were stable and negatively correlated with fish size, suggesting an ontogenetic shift in home range development.","Moi Univ, Dept Fisheries, Eldoret, Kenya; Mem Univ Newfoundland, Inst Marine, St John, NF A1C 5R3, Canada",Moi University; Memorial University Newfoundland,"Moi Univ, Dept Fisheries, POB 1125, Eldoret, Kenya.",b_kaunda@yahoo.com,,,,,,,29,34,42,0,13,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

Currently, the Coral Sea area and its seamounts (north-east Australia) are under review to determine if MPAs are warranted. The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans. Acoustic telemetry was used to determine residency, site fidelity and spatial use of three shark species at Osprey Reef: whitetip reef sharks Triaenodon obesus, grey reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (similar to 14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of similar to 250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner. The high residency and limited spatial use of Osprey Reef suggests that reef sharks would be highly vulnerable to targeted fishing pressure and that MPAs incorporating no-take of sharks would be effective in protecting reef shark populations at Osprey and Shark Reef.","[Barnett, Adam] Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Abrantes, Katya G.; Seymour, Jamie; Fitzpatrick, Richard] James Cook Univ, Sch Marine & Trop Biol, Cairns, Qld, Australia; [Barnett, Adam; Fitzpatrick, Richard] Reef Channel, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of Tasmania; James Cook University,"Barnett, A (corresponding author), Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Fisheries Aquaculture & Coasts Ctr, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",adam.barnett@utas.edu.au,"Barnett, Anthony/A-8205-2019; Seymour, Jamie/C-9748-2013","Barnett, Adam/0000-0001-7430-8428; Seymour, Jamie/0000-0002-4805-3289","Digital Dimensions, Australia; Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia; Digital Dimensions","Digital Dimensions, Australia; Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia; Digital Dimensions","Funding was supplied by Digital Dimensions, Australia, through the production of the Discovery Channel Shark Week special 'Mysteries of the Shark Coast' and by the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) Australia.

In this study, patterns of movement and home range for Lethrinus harak and Lethrinus obsoletus were quantified using an array of 33 acoustic receivers that covered approximately three quarters of Piti Marine Reserve in the Pacific island of Guam. This array was designed to ensure extensive overlap of receiver ranges throughout the study area. Eighteen individuals (12 L. harak and 6 L. obsoletus) were surgically implanted with ultrasonic transmitters and passively tracked for 4 months. Both species displayed high site fidelity and had relatively small home ranges. The home ranges of L. harak expanded with increasing body size. Feeding of fish by humans, which was common but restricted to a small area within the study site, had little effect on the distribution of the resident populations. L. harak made nightly spawning migrations within the reserve between full moon and last quarter moon of each lunar cycle, coinciding with a strong ebbing tide. Results indicate that even small reserves can include many individual home ranges of these emperorfishes and can protect spawning sites for L. harak. These species are heavily targeted in Guam, and there are major demographic differences between fished and protected sites. This study shows the potential for protected areas to sustain reproductive viability in exploited populations.","[Taylor, B.
