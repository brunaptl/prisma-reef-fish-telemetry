Their spatial ecology is poorly understood, creating challenges for effective conservation of this enigmatic marine predator. Using acoustic telemetry and network analyses, we describe the movement patterns of 15 mature great hammerhead sharks (207-331.5 cm fork length) primarily within the waters of the southeastern United States from April 2019 to December 2022, including identifying movement corridors, core use areas and seasonal shifts in habitat use. Great hammerheads exhibited partial migration; some sharks undertook consistent, repeatable, round-trip migrations between the tagging site in the Florida Keys and northern points in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coast. Conversely, others remained in the Florida Keys year-round. Network analysis coupled with community detection algorithms revealed that individual great hammerheads displayed oceanic basin affinity, favouring migration to either the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico. Great hammerheads that remained in the Florida Keys shifted their habitat use seasonally from inshore channels (spring and summer) to offshore artificial reefs and the natural reef tract (summer through winter). These shifts may be driven by prey availability, as core use areas often corresponded to known locations of seasonal spawning aggregations for reef fish. These data fill an important knowledge gap for great hammerhead migratory patterns that can improve spatial management strategies for this historically overexploited species. We discuss the importance of drawing upon data from multiple tagging locations for highly mobile species management, particularly in the designation of essential fish habitat.",2025-04-03,Bruna,Excluded,"Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

Part of the original rebuilding plan included designation of a yelloweye rockfish conservation area, a rocky reef closed off the Central Coast of Oregon that is closed to bottom fishing. The yelloweye rockfish conservation area's ability to help rebuild the population, is predicated on the theory that demersal rockfishes are relatively sedentary. However, in the years since being declared overfished, acoustic tagging studies suggested yelloweye rockfish did not remain in the yelloweye rockfish conservation area. However, where they went remained a mystery. In this paper we describe the use of pop-off satellite tags to conduct a mark-recapture study of 11 yelloweye rockfish tagged within the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area. We used back-in-time particle tracking coupled with an ocean circulation model in an attempt to increase the precision in the location at which each tag shed off the fish, and further validated that location by associating it to the underlying seafloor habitat type. Ten out of eleven tags were shed from the fish while it was outside the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area's boundary. While most fish remained within 50 km of the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area, one tagged fish swam to an offshore reef off Central Washington (similar to 40 km from the shore). Backtracked locations were more likely over rock than the initial satellite transmission, indicating the method was effective at identifying tag shed locations. We found no relationship between days at large, fish sex or length and the distance between release site and shed location. Our work supports a growing body of work that suggests yelloweye rockfish have less site fidelity than previously hypothesized.",2025-02-27,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

To provide baseline data for the assessing these impacts on fisheries, we tracked the movements of Japanese spiny lobsters (Panulirus japonicus), a commercially important species, using acoustic telemetry in an area that was designated by the government as a promotion zone for OWF development. Acoustic tags were attached to 23 adult lobsters (CL = 97.9 f 17.7 mm), which were then released in an isolated rocky reef frequently used by local fishermen as a lobster fishing ground. The tagged lobsters were detected within the reef for 7-97 (mean f SD = 52 f 29) days, with five individuals remaining within the reef > 90 days. The duration of home-area occupancy during which lobsters likely occupied the same or adjacent shelters within the reef ranged 2-42 (mean f SD = 5.7 f 5.8) days. Movement network analyses revealed that lobsters often relocated shelters both within and between habitat patches, with some traveling over 1-km per night to reach another patch. These findings suggest that if OWF structures function as new habitats for this species, the structures' introduction could alter the lobsters' spatial distribution and movement network. We believe that a comparative approach examining the space use of commercial species before and after OWF development is essential for determining the precise impacts of OWF introduction on local fisheries.",2025-02-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Non-fish species,__EXR__Non-fish species",

Acoustic telemetry is arguably the most popular method used to study the movements of fish. Despite this method being able to elucidate many aspects of movement behavior, including residency, home range, and migration, among others, one aspect that remains challenging is the study and definition of connectivity, particularly within marine seascapes. As such, this review assesses published literature on acoustic telemetry studies, which have specifically assessed some aspect of fish connectivity, and discusses these in terms of study distribution and overall trends, the diversity of taxa and life stage assessed, the role that large-scale acoustic telemetry networks plays in assessing connectivity of marine fishes, how connectivity studies have been used in an applied context, and proposes definitions linked to specific types of connectivity, which will assist future researchers when conceptualizing studies. Further, methods that can be used in conjunction with acoustic telemetry to complement the data are discussed. Given that marine resources and habitats are intricately connected, this review highlights the critical role that acoustic telemetry can play in assessing this link. It is envisaged that our developed framework of connectivity definitions will assist future studies and stakeholders in assessing ecosystem functioning and ultimately contribute to improved conservation and management of marine fish populations and ecosystems.",2024-12-05,Bruna,Excluded,"Review article,__EXR__Review article",

However, most studies have focused on the diurnal component of these aspects; nocturnal patterns are less known. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing diel movement patterns in ecologically and commercially important nocturnal coral reef fishes. We evaluate 122-days of acoustic telemetry data from 4 nocturnal species in 2 coral reef fish families (Haemulidae and Lutjanidae) on the Great Barrier Reef. For all species, we found a clear division between daytime resting areas on the reef and a move towards off-reef areas at night. This was highlighted in the low number of detections at night and the high average transitions between receivers at twilight. Over our study period, average nocturnal space use area (minimum convex polygon) of Plectorhincus gibbosus was 328,089 m2, Plectorhincus lineatus 28,828 m2, and Lutjanus carponotatus 20,369 m2. However, results from a Principal Component Analysis revealed that space use, and movement, varied substantially within species; for 3 of the 4 species the main axis of variation correlated with individual-level behaviour. These large differences in individual space use patterns highlight the need for caution when using species averages when considering ecosystem functions. Overall, our preliminary observations provide a glimpse into the large spatial extent, potential habitat connectivity, and intra and interspecific variation in activity patterns among large nocturnal Indo-Pacific reef fishes. This highlights their potential importance in maintaining ecosystem links between coral reefs and adjacent habitats.",2024-12-01,Bruna,Included,,

The invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea, first documented in the Caribbean in 2002, has rapidly expanded its range, displacing native seagrasses, and overgrowing bare sand. The southern stingray (Hypanus americanus) uses shallow seagrass and sand habitats for foraging. This paper examined the impacts of the invasive seagrass, H. stipulacea, on southern stingray behavior, foraging and movement patterns using acoustic telemetry and visual observations. From 2015 to 2018, 15 southern stingrays (14 juveniles of unknown sex and 1 female) were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored within an acoustic array in Brewers and Perseverance Bays, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. The residence time, rates of movement and activity spaces for 50% and 95% utilization distributions (UD) were calculated for day and night periods. Tagged southern stingrays were detected within the array on average for 260 d (range 11-801 d) and residency for all individuals averaged 53% over the monitoring period (1079 d). Mean rates of movement per individual ranged from 40 to 150 m h(-1), was lowest during the nighttime and were significantly higher during crepuscular periods. Activity spaces during day and night periods were nearly identical and averaged 0.05 km(2) and 0.25 km(2) for 50% and 95% UD, respectively. Distances between day and night 50% UD activity spaces was 148 m (range 8-409 m) and mean percent overlap was 38%. In addition to acoustic monitoring, benthic cover of available habitats and visual surveys of stingray behavior and habitat preferences were conducted along fixed transects. Monotypic stands of the invasive H. stipulacea seagrass represented 42% of benthic cover, followed by bare sand (27%), mixed patches of native and invasive seagrasses (23%) and the native Syringodium filiforme (7%). A habitat selection index (HSI) comparing the percent cover of available habitats and habitats occupied by stingrays found a strong preference for the native seagrass S. filiforme (HSI = 2.30) and bare sand (HSI = 1.79) compared to H. stipulacea (HSI = 0.70). Visual surveys also revealed that 50% of foraging stingrays were in S. filiforme, while 28% and 17% were foraging in H. stipulacea and bare sand, respectively. Our results are an important baseline for examining how further expansion of H. stipulacea may affect southern stingray movement patterns and foraging preferences.",2024-12-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

Multiple shark species rely on coral reefs as important habitat and, as such, play a number of significant ecological roles in these ecosystems. How environmental stress impacts routine, site-attached reef shark behavior, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we combine 8 years of acoustic tracking data (2013-2020) from grey reef sharks resident to the remote coral reefs of the Chagos Archipelago in the Central Indian Ocean, with a satellite-based index of coral reef environmental stress exposure. We show that on average across the region, increased stress on the reefs significantly reduces grey reef shark residency, promoting more diffuse space use and increasing time away from shallow forereefs. Importantly, this impact has a lagged effect for up to 16 months. This may have important physiological and conservation consequences for reef sharks, as well as broader implications for reef ecosystem functioning. As climate change is predicted to increase environmental stress on coral reef ecosystems, understanding how site-attached predators respond to stress will be crucial for forecasting the functional significance of altering predator behavior and the potential impacts on conservation for both reef sharks and coral reefs themselves.        Environmental stress on coral reefs is increasing. Authors show a stress-related reduction in residency of grey reef sharks on the remote reefs of the Chagos Archipelago, promoting more diffuse space use and increased time away from the shallow forereefs.",2024-09-09,Bruna,Excluded,"Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

However, many knowledge gaps about their biology and ecology hinder conservation efforts. Here we used a combination of acoustic telemetry and acceleration datalogger technology to gain fundamental insights into the fine-scale behaviour, habitat use, size of activity spaces, and residency of adult female bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae) in the Ningaloo region of northwestern Australia. Acoustic tracking data over one year demonstrated that female bottlenose wedgefish continuously resided in a relatively small area of a productive coral reef lagoon. Acceleration data revealed that bottlenose wedgefish were nocturnal, with time of day having a greater influence on activity than tidal patterns. Bottlenose wedgefish also increased activity with seasonally increasing temperatures. We identified several discrete behavioural signatures in the acceleration data, inferred to correspond to chafing, settling/burying behaviour, foraging behaviour, and escape behaviour, based on their kinematics. Further observations are required to confirm these behaviours with certainty. Additionally, according to datalogger and acoustic data, tagged bottlenose wedgefish rarely inhabited areas greater than 2 m deep. Together, these first insights into behaviour and habitat use of adult female bottlenose wedgefish highlight the importance of nearshore habitats for this species and indicate that they may be highly resident to specific areas. Our findings provide important insight into the conservation of bottlenose wedgefish in northwestern Australia, including potential effectiveness of protected areas and interactions with specific anthropogenic threats such as shoreline development and recreational beach fishing.",2024-09-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

Despite their increased use in recent years, the choice of structures used at artificial reefs remains largely haphazard due to the lack of information on reef structure performance. Few studies have examined the use of different artificial reef structures by individual fish. From 2021-2022, we acoustically tagged 72 black sea bass (Centropristis striata), 34 gag (Mycteroperca mircrolepis), 27 greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), nine almaco jack (S. rivoliana), and eight red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) on four artificial reef complexes near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, U.S. Available artificial reef structures consisted of materials of various sizes and heights made of concrete and metal. We tracked tagged fish using a fine-scale positioning system for similar to 100 days. Black sea bass exhibited high site fidelity to the artificial structure where we caught them, rarely moving away from that structure. The limited movement resulted in low transition probabilities; we conclude that black sea bass do not select for particular artificial structures. Gag and red snapper moved greater distances away from artificial structures and routinely moved between them. Greater amberjack and almaco jack moved the most within the complexes displaying circling behavior around individual structures and were the only species that regularly moved off the artificial reef complexes. Greater amberjack movements away from artificial sites were most commonly directed to surrounding shipwrecks. Whereas gag, red snapper, almaco jack, and greater amberjack used all available structures, they consistently selected for high relief structures, such as vessels, more than other structures. These results will be useful to managers charged with decisions on what types of structures to place at artificial reef complexes to supplement or enhance habitat for economically important fishes.",2024-04-11,Bruna,Included,Artificial reefs,"{""Bruna""=>[""Artificial reef""]}"

We analysed the vertical movements of silvertip sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus using pop-up archival tags deployed on 7 individuals in the Chagos Archipelago, central Indian Ocean. The sharks changed depth predictably with water column thermal structure, moving deeper with seasonal increases in mixed layer depth while occupying a narrow ambient water temperature range around similar to 27 degrees C. At shorter timescales, higher resolution data from 5 tags showed that silvertip shark depth varied cyclically with surface light levels, increasing during daylight and on nights around the full moon. This matches the diel vertical migrations of many fish species, suggesting that the sharks' light-driven depth changes might relate to foraging. While most vertical movements (>98%) were within the mixed layer, deeper dives to 200-800 m occurred approximately every 3 d. High-resolution data from one recovered tag showed the shark ascending deep (>200 m) dives in 2 sharply defined phases, initially fast then slow. Analysis of dive profiles against dissolved oxygen (DO) data suggested that the shark may have ascended rapidly to escape low DO levels at depth, then reduced its ascent rate by 50-80% once DO levels increased. While a small sample, the electronic tags deployed in this study revealed the silvertip sharks' predictable use of mixed layer waters, narrow thermal range and apparent intolerance of hypoxic conditions. These characteristics may exacerbate the species' vulnerability as oceanic warming and shoaling oxygen minimum zones modify vertical habitat availability.",2023-08-24,Bruna,Excluded,"Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

The 370,200 detections of 57 seabass in the study area revealed high residency in the period from late March-May to September-November, as well as high site fidelity (70.7%). Whereas the majority of seabass left the area in winter, 13 seabass stayed in the harbour experiencing temperatures as low as 2.8 & DEG;C. Two groups of seabass were identified having different core movement areas in the inner and outer harbours, although movement between the two areas was possible. The distinct differences in habitat use between these groups resulted in a significantly different level of exposure to fisheries under the same policy framework.

Goliath grouper in the southeastern US form annual spawning aggregations on high-relief reefs located offshore of both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida, US. To determine spawning site fidelity and describe migration patterns to aggregations, we implanted 50 adult goliath grouper with acoustic transmitter tags from 2010 to 2013. Fish were tagged at known spawning sites off the Florida Atlantic coast and tracked as they moved through the FACT Network array of acoustic receivers. From 2010 to 2020, we collected similar to 7 million detections from tagged goliath grouper at 153 sites along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. Results of this long-term tracking indicate that adult goliath grouper are relatively sedentary during non-spawning months (Nov to June) but move significantly more prior to, during, and immediately after spawning (July to Oct). Inter-annual spawning site fidelity was high: between 80-93% of tagged fish returned to the same spawning sites each year. Arrival timing at spawning sites coincided with the August new moon, with males arriving earlier than females.

One of the most important tourism sectors in aquatic environments is scuba diving, an activity considered sustainable given its non-extractive nature and capability of bringing relevant socio-economic benefits to local communities. However, knowledge about its impact on the activity patterns of aquatic animals is still scarce. Here, we used biotelemetry techniques to assess the importance of scuba diving in modulating the activity patterns of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus, Lowe, 1834), a marine predatory fish of high interest for fishing and tourism. We implemented Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on high-resolution acceleration data using a temporal and spatial control while controlling for a set of environmental variables (i.e. photoperiod, time-of-day, moon phase, temperature, wave height, and intensity and direction of marine currents) within a multiple-use marine protected area, and diving tourism hot-spot, of the western Mediterranean Sea. Our results underlined the more decisive influence of environmental-related stressors on the activity patterns of the dusky grouper compared to the impact of scuba diving. A high heterogeneity existed in the response against most of the stressors, including the presence of scuba divers. Overall, the activity of dusky grouper was higher at night than at day, showing a positive relationship with wave height, water temperature, and current intensity and a negative one with the moon phase. Remarkably, our findings, based on novel biotelemetry tools, differed substantially from the common wisdom accepted for this species. In conclusion, there is no clear evidence of scuba divers influence on the general activity patterns of the dusky grouper.

However, few studies have focused on the fine-scale movements related to reproduction, a key feature in a population's perpetuation. Knowledge of movements modulated by reproduction is particularly important since migrations towards spawning grounds may increase the vulnerability to threats if these occur outside protected areas. Further, reproductive behavioural polymorphism is widely understudied but may affect reproductive success. In this work, we used acoustic telemetry to study a harvested fish, Diplodus sargus, within a small no-take zone in Portugal. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to focus on both the environmental and spatial features affecting D. sargus reproduction and the first to explore intraspecific variability of spawning movements. We report, during the spawning period, short-term (<1 d) and synchronised wider movements towards the open sea and deeper areas-'extraordinary movements'-involving 34% of the individuals. These extraordinary movements were associated with environmental factors known to trigger reproduction in this species (low but increasing photoperiod and temperature, waxing and full moon phases). Our results suggest that different behavioural groups (residents, commuters and low site-attached fish) exhibiting differences in spatial use may aggregate and spawn simultaneously, which may contribute to the maintenance of behavioural polymorphisms and the species' evolutionary adaptability.

Among five cohorts, the percentage of unrelated pairs within a cohort is more than 62% in average, suggesting a potential high mortality during their early life stage. The results of Fst and assignment testing showed that there was no significant genetic structure between sites and cohorts indicating that there was no fine scale genetic structure, even though the juveniles possessed strong site fidelity.

One of the most fundamental unresolved issues in understanding animal navigation is how the brain represents spatial information. Although navigation has been studied extensively in many taxa, the key efforts to determine the neural basis of navigation have focused on mammals, usually in lab experiments, where the allocated space is typically very small; e.g., up to one order of magnitude the size of the animal, is limited by artificial walls, and contains only a few objects. This type of setting is vastly different from the habitat of animals in the wild, which is open in many cases and is virtually limitless in size compared to its inhabitants. Thus, a fundamental open question in animal navigation is whether small-scale, spatially confined, and artificially crafted lab experiments indeed reveal how navigation is enacted in the real world. This question is difficult to study given the technical problems associated with in vivo electrophysiology in natural settings. Here, we argue that these difficulties can be overcome by implementing state of the art technology when studying the rivulated rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus as the model animal. As a first step toward this goal, using acoustic tracking of the reef, we demonstrate that individual S. rivulatus have a defined home range of about 200 m in length, from which they seldom venture. They repeatedly visit the same areas and return to the same sleeping grounds, thus providing evidence for their ability to navigate in the reef environment. Using a clustering algorithm to analyze segments of daily trajectories, we found evidence of specific repeating patterns in behavior within the home range of individual fish. Thus, S. rivulatus appears to have the ability to carry out its daily routines and revisit places of interest by employing sophisticated means of navigation while exploring its surroundings. In the future, using novel technologies for wireless recording from single cells of fish brains, S. rivulatus can emerge as an ideal system to study the neural basis of navigation in natural settings and lead to ""electrophysiology in the wild.""",2022-07-05,Bruna,Included,,

For both species, fish densities were significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost. The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs, predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were small (0.10 to 0.45 km(2)), and both species presented spatially segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88% for S. axillare and 95% for L. alexandrei.

We used acoustic telemetry to track horizontal movement along the reef, depth, and activity (through tri-axial accelerometers), and quantify the effect of environmental factors such as water temperature and algal abundance on long-term patterns. We found that in the species examined, nearly all individuals maintained a highly consistent spatial pattern throughout the study duration, in which they repeatedly moved along a distinct route between nighttime sleeping areas and spatially constrained daytime areas. Individual patterns were surprisingly conserved over time, despite seasonal changes and variation in resource abundance. Individuals differed considerably in their daily travel distance, with some traveling up to 2000 m along the reef, while others moved only between deep and shallow areas. Activity levels consistently peaked around mid-day, regardless of the location of their daytime areas, which behavioral surveys confirm are associated with feeding activities. We also detected peaks in activity during early mornings when surveys detect that parrotfish interacted in large aggregates (typically 30-60 individuals). Our findings indicate that space-use patterns vary among individuals but are extremely conservative within individuals over long time periods. This in turn may have important consequences to the health of reefs, as individual parrotfish may be less likely to alter foraging patterns as conditions change. Furthermore, the high fidelity to limited sleeping and daytime areas may be a source of concern, as local small-scale disturbances may strongly disrupt individual space-use patterns.",2022-08-01,Bruna,Included,Herbivorous fish,

This is particularly relevant to large and wide-ranging marine predators including many elasmobranchs (sharks and rays), for which region-specific space-use information is limited. Further, uncertainty remains in how to integrate movement datasets with systematic conservation planning frameworks to meet explicit conservation objectives. We addressed these knowledge gaps by combining movement models, constructed from passive acoustic telemetry data for eight elasmobranch species, and systematic conservation planning to investigate the design and adequacy of MPAs in Bimini, The Bahamas. Currently, there is a proposal for a no-take MPA in North Bimini (NBMPA), although it is unclear how this MPA would benefit elasmobranch communities if or when imple-mented. Our results show that although the NBMPA would contribute to elasmobranch conservation, the sup-plementation with an additional MPA southwest of Bimini would be necessary to protect important habitats for multiple elasmobranch species. This southwestern area was highlighted as a conservation priority area of both permanent MPA designs as well as seasonal time-area closures, regardless of NBMPA implementation status and conservation targets considered in this study.

Lionfish movement was lowest at night and greatest during crepuscular periods, with fish acceleration (m s(-2)) increasing with water temperature during these times. Our results help reconcile observed patterns of rapid recolonization following lionfish removal, and suggest complex drivers likely result in highly variable patterns of movement for similarly sized fish occupying the same habitat. Culling areas >= the average lionfish home range size identified here (i.e. similar to 10 ha) or habitat patches isolated by >= similar to 180 m (radius of average home range) may minimize subsequent recolonization.

An example is cleaning symbiosis, which has been observed in terrestrial and marine environments. The most recognized form of marine cleaning symbiosis is that of cleaner fishes and their clients.        Cleaner species set up cleaning stations on the reef, and other species seek out their services. However, it is not well understood how the presence of cleaning stations influence movements of large highly mobile species. We examined the role of cleaning stations as a driver of movement and habitat use in a mobile client species.        Here, we used a combination of passive acoustic telemetry and in-water surveys to investigate cleaning station attendance by the reef manta ray Mobula alfredi. We employed a novel approach in the form of a fine-scale acoustic receiver array set up around a known cleaning area and tagged 42 rays. Within the array, we mapped structural features, surveyed the distribution of cleaner wrasse, and observed the habitat use of the rays.        We found manta ray space use was significantly associated with blue-streak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus distribution and hard coral substrate. Cleaning interactions dominated their habitat use at this site, taking precedence over other life history traits such as feeding and courtship.        This study has demonstrated that cleaning symbiosis is a driver for highly mobile, and otherwise pelagic, species to visit inshore reef environments. We suggest that targeted and long-term use of specific cleaning stations reflects manta rays having a long-term memory and cognitive map of some shallow reef environments where quality cleaning is provided.

In this study, the authors used acoustic telemetry to detect the diel vertical movement patterns of S. ovifrons, video survey to detect its feeding depths and substrata and focal follow survey and genetic analysis to identify algae composition on the feeding scars at Kashiwajima Island, southwestern Japan (32 degrees 46 ' N, 132 degrees 38 ' E). Acoustic telemetry revealed that S. ovifrons spent most of its time in shallow water (<10 m) during the day and slept in deeper water (10-15 m) at night. Video and focal follow surveys revealed that most fishes of various sizes regularly took bites on epilithic algae and detrital materials on rocky substrata at depths of <10 m, but large fishes (>40 cm total length) sometimes took bites directly on live corals (Acropora solitaryensis) at the 5 m depth zone where live tabular corals dominated the benthos. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that epilithic algae collected from feeding scars were mainly composed of Rhodophyta, and coralline algae were less often targeted.

Effective conservation and management can facilitate population recoveries. However, these efforts depend on robust data on movement patterns and stock structure, which are lacking for many threatened species, including the Critically Endangered soupfin shark Galeorhinus galeus, a circumglobal coastal-pelagic species.        Using passive acoustic telemetry, we continuously tracked 34 mature female soupfin sharks, surgically implanted with coded acoustic transmitters, for 7 years via 337 underwater acoustic receivers stationed along the west coast of North America. These sharks and an additional six were also externally fitted with spaghetti identification tags. Our tagging site was a shallow rocky reef off La Jolla (San Diego County), California, USA, where adult females were observed to aggregate every summer.        Tagged soupfin sharks were highly migratory along the west coast of North America, between Washington, USA and Baja California Sur, Mexico. However, every 3 years, they returned to waters off La Jolla, California, where they underwent gestation. This is the first conclusive evidence of triennial migration and philopatry ('home-loving') in any animal, which is apparently driven by this species' unusual triennial reproductive cycle. Females of other shark and ray species with triennial reproductive cycles are also likely to exhibit triennial cycles of migration and philopatry.        At least six (15%) of our tagged soupfin sharks were killed in commercial gillnets in Mexico.        Policy implications. Identifying multiennial migratory cycles in mature female sharks can reveal hidden stock structure in the form of discrete breeding cohorts, which are spatially and temporally segregated as they cycle through different reproductive phases. Accounting for this complexity may improve the performance of spatially structured stock assessment models, particularly when fishery removals are spatially heterogeneous, as well as inform the spatiotemporal design of fishery-independent surveys. In the United States, the soupfin shark is neither actively managed nor recognized as a Highly Migratory Species; however, given the highly migratory behaviour we report, this designation should be revisited by the US Pacific Fishery Management Council.

Fish from different bays did not mix and wander throughout the ecosystem even though it is all suitable habitat and is used by different groups of localized individuals. This similarity of occupancy patterns is limited to the spatial scale of bays and temporal scales of weeks or months. When considered at the resolution of individual receivers and hourly time steps, most fish are not in close proximity to one another for the vast majority of the time. Although some pairs of fish had as many as 84% of their hourly detections on the same receivers in the month after tagging, they gradually spent less time near each other, even though their overall pattern of movements was consistent at the scale of whole bays.

Twenty acoustically tagged individuals (56-84 cm, 70.01 +/- 7.40 cm; total length, mean +/- SD) maintained consistent home reef sites, although some fish regularly shifted activity centers within the home site, often following a seasonal spawning migration. Seven fish with depth-coded tags showed a higher probability of vertical movement in the hours immediately following dawn and preceding dusk.

Fish were kept outside their natural environment for several days before release for pre- and post-tagging surveys. Moreover, 47% of them were not released at their capture site. Half of all individuals (all species) showed a high level of side fidelity immediately upon release. During this period, they were detected in the same place, by a small and constant number of hydrophones. This site fidelity pattern was also observed for the other fish (50%; all species) but after 1 to 18 days of an unsettled pattern, during which the fish moved significantly along the reef slope (high activity). During this short period, the distances travelled were significantly higher than during the subsequent period of site fidelity (several km vs. a few hundred m). We hypothesize that these unsettled patterns might result from fish experimental displacement (homing behavior) and from post-capture captivity (the fish had to recover a niche within the ecosystem). Consequently, we suggest that fish be released where they were caught to limit the movements associated with homing behavior. Periods of captivity should be avoided as much as possible.

Within marine environments, prey detectability (e.g., via visual or chemical cues) is affected by environmental conditions (e.g., water clarity and tidal flow), such that specialist predators would be expected to synchronize their foraging activity with cyclic variation in such conditions. In the present study, we combined behavioral-ecology experiments on captive sea snakes and their prey (catfish) with acoustic tracking of free-ranging sea snakes, to explore the use of waterborne chemical cues in this predator-prey interaction.

Discrepancies between broad- and fine-scale habitat inferences suggest that positioning systems are necessary for interpreting habitat use in complex coral reef ecosystems.

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to infer movement patterns of seven adult C. latus within Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a no-take marine protected area (MPA) northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, a preliminary exploration of detections recorded outside of BIRNM was used to gain knowledge of the potential for larger scale movements. Ascertaining long-term movement patterns, including residency, mobility, and identifying core activity spaces can play a considerable role in how MPAs, like BIRNM, are adapted to meet the needs of mobile species.ResultsHigh residency index values were observed for individual C. latus within the BIRNM array (meanSE: 0.913 +/- 0.04, range 0.75-1.0) across the 17 months monitored. Most fish were also detected on receivers located outside BIRNM. An observed to expected detection ratio revealed that despite high residency, only 9.6% of expected transmissions were detected based on the average tag transmission rate. Network analysis revealed high individual connectivity with many of the receivers inside BIRNM and a large number of core use receivers (mean: 10.7, range 6-14) within individual networks.ConclusionsMost C. latus were present in BIRNM at least twice per day, but were overall detected below the expected rates, demonstrating mobility, large core activity spaces and wide use of the acoustic array inside BIRNM and greater St. Croix shelf. How residency is inferred from acoustic telemetry detections, and interpreted for species with variable mobility, has important considerations for spatial management planning and telemetry analyses. For MPA development to meet the spatial requirements of species with mixed resident-mobile spatial ecology, detailed long-term movement data are required.

We predicted horn sharks would use an area restricted search (ARS) movement strategy to locate dense resource patches while minimizing energetic costs of travel and nighttime activity. As ectotherms, we predicted environmental temperature would play a significant role in driving movement and activity patterns. Methods Continuous active acoustic tracking methods and acceleration data loggers were used to quantify the diel fine-scale spatial movements and activity patterns of horn sharks. First passage time was used to identify the scale and locations of patches indicative of ARS. Activity was assessed using overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as a proxy for energy expenditure. Behavior within a patch was characterized into three activity patterns: resting, episodic burst activity, and moderate, consistent activity. Results After resting in daytime shelters, individuals travelled to multiple reefs throughout the night, traversing through depths of 2-112 m and temperatures of 10.0-23.8 degrees C. All sharks exhibited area restricted search patch use and arrived at their first patch approximately 3.4 +/- 2.2 h (mean +/- SD) after sunset. Sharks exhibited moderate, consistent activity in 54% of the patches used, episodic burst activity in 33%, and few (13%) were identified as resting at night. ODBA peaked while sharks were swimming through relatively deeper (similar to 30 m), colder channels when traversing from one patch to the next. There was no consistent pattern between ODBA and temperature. Conclusions We provide one of the largest fine-scale, high-resolution paired data sets for an elasmobranch movement ecology study. Horn sharks exhibited ARS movement patterns for various activity patterns. Individuals likely travel to reefs known to have profitable and predictable patches, potentially tolerating less suitable environmental temperatures.

Here, we use empirical animal tracking data from 459 individual sharks and baited remote underwater video surveys undertaken in 36 countries to construct an empirically supported individual-based model that estimates the conservation effectiveness of MPAs for five species of coral reef-associated sharks (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus perezi, and Ginglymostoma cirratum). We demonstrate how species-specific individual movement traits can contribute to fishing mortality of sharks found within MPAs as they move outside to adjacent fishing grounds. We discovered that the world's officially recorded coral reef-based managed areas (with a median width of 9.4 km) would need to be enforced as strict no-take MPAs and up to 5 times larger to expect protection of the majority of individuals of the five investigated reef shark species. The magnitude of this effect depended on local abundances and fishing pressure, with MPAs required to be 1.6-2.6 times larger to protect the same number of Atlantic and Caribbean species, which occur at lower abundances than similar species in the western Pacific. Furthermore, our model was used to quantify partially substantial reductions (>50%) in fishing mortality resulting from small increases in MPA size, allowing us to bridge a critical gap between traditional conservation planning and fisheries management.

Wild red snapper were surgically implanted at depth and monitored for 16 months over artificial and natural reefs. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0-0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had significant effects on ODBA and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to differing feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily influence red snapper and that they behave differently on specific habitat types at certain times.

We satellite-tagged 26 animals from six species (Blue Marlin, Reef Mantas, Sailfish, Silky Sharks, Silvertip Sharks, and Yellowfin Tuna), producing 2,735 days of movement data. We also acoustically tagged 121 sharks from two species (Grey Reef and Silvertip Sharks), which were monitored for up to 40 months across a large acoustic receiver array spanning the MPA. We found that the activity spaces of all satellite-tagged animals, including pelagic species, were much smaller than the area of the BIOT MPA, even taking into account errors associated with position estimates. Estimates of space use of acoustically tagged sharks, based on dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMM), were also much smaller than the size of the MPA. However, we found important limitations when using dBBMM and demonstrate its sensitivity to both study duration and array design.

Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C.

However, trends in declines have been coupled with reports of high abundance in some areas providing confusion about what healthy reef shark populations should look like. Given that coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse and productive habitats, but also are one of the most threatened by climate change due to the effects of rising temperature and declining pH, there is a need to understand reef sharks to better predict consequences for their populations.

Many marine ectothermic predators behave like CPF animals, but never stop swimming, suggesting that predators will incur 'travelling' costs while resting. Currently, it is unknown how these CPF predators behave or how modulation of behavior contributes to daily energy budgets. We combine acoustic telemetry, multi-sensor loggers, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate 'activity seascapes', which combine space use with patterns of activity, for reef sharks (blacktip reef and grey reef sharks) at an unfished Pacific atoll.        Results: Sharks of both species occupied a central place during the day within deeper, cooler water where they were less active, and became more active over a larger area at night in shallower water. However, video cameras on two grey reef sharks revealed foraging attempts/success occurring throughout the day, and that multiple sharks were refuging in common areas. A simple bioenergetics model for grey reef sharks predicted that diel changes in energy expenditure are primarily driven by changes in swim speed and not body temperature.        Conclusions: We provide a new method for simultaneously visualizing diel space use and behavior in marine predators, which does not require the simultaneous measure of both from each animal. We show that blacktip and grey reef sharks behave as CPFs, with diel changes in activity, horizontal and vertical space use.

We assessed ecosystem and trophic connectivity of two common reef fishes (schoolmaster, Lut-janus apodus; white grunt, Haemulon plumierii) and one predator (great barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda) in a Caribbean MSP ecosystem using acoustic telemetry and natural dietary tracers. Triangulated positions from an acoustic positioning system indicated that L. apodus and H. plumierii relied on multiple habitats within this MSP ecosystem, occupying areas with more cover (lower risk) during the day and areas with less cover (higher risk) at night. During the day, both species exhibited limited movement away from structured habitats (e.g., mangroves, patch reef) and avoided the primary activity space of S. barracuda in the central channel over sand bottom or seagrass. At night, L. apodus moved into the channel and adjacent seagrass beds on the margin of this high-risk area when S. barracuda occurrence was reduced, suggesting that this species adjusts its foraging activities to minimize encounter rates with predators. Haemulon plumierii also displayed distinct day-night shifts with directed movements at twilight across higher risk habitat to nighttime locations in seagrass. Conspicuous changes in the rate of movement were also detected at different times of the day, and observed mismatches between movement rates of S. barracuda and our two potential prey species appeared to be a behavioral response to reduce their vulnerability. Dietary tracer analysis supported the premise that observed shifts to nocturnal habitats were associated with foraging, with significant contributions of organic matter derived from nighttime locations.

Integration of multiple analyses revealed that species with similar sizes and similar diets displayed clear spatial segregation, both between habitats and depth.

Range-testing a submerged passive acoustic receiver array in a Caribbean coral reef habitat,"Submerged passive acoustic technology allows researchers to investigate spatial and temporal movement patterns of many marine and freshwater species. The technology uses receivers to detect and record acoustic transmissions emitted from tags attached to an individual. Acoustic signal strength naturally attenuates over distance, but numerous environmental variables also affect the probability a tag is detected. Knowledge of receiver range is crucial for designing acoustic arrays and analyzing telemetry data. Here, we present a method for testing a relatively large-scale receiver array in a dynamic Caribbean coastal environment intended for long-term monitoring of multiple species. The U.S. Geological Survey and several academic institutions in collaboration with resource management at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), off the coast of St. Croix, recently deployed a 52 passive acoustic receiver array. We targeted 19 array-representative receivers for range-testing by submersing fixed delay interval range-testing tags at various distance intervals in each cardinal direction from a receiver for a minimum of an hour. Using a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we estimated the probability of detection across the array and assessed the effect of water depth, habitat, wind, temperature, and time of day on the probability of detection. The predicted probability of detection across the entire array at 100m distance from a receiver was 58.2% (95% CI: 44.0-73.0%) and dropped to 26.0% (95% CI: 11.4-39.3%) 200m from a receiver indicating a somewhat constrained effective detection range.

Traditionally, stock assessments measure reproductive potential as spawning stock biomass or egg production and do not include other aspects of reproductive behavior. Red drum make an excellent case study to assess these other aspects, as (1) they are highly fecund, pelagic spawners, like most exploited marine fishes; (2) their life cycle is delineated between nursery (estuarine) and adult (coastal and offshore) habitat; and (3) they are managed at these two spatial scales. This study was conducted from August 2012 to December 2013 and integrates data from multiple methods and spatial scales. Aerial surveys were used for large-scale monitoring of aggregations off two known estuarine nursery areas, Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, Florida, USA. Capture-based sampling in Tampa Bay coastal (n = 2581) and estuarine waters (n = 158) was used to assess reproductive state and to confirm coastal spawning. To assess spatial dynamics, we acoustically tagged two population components in the Tampa Bay system, subadults from the estuary (n = 20) and adults from the coastal spawning site (n = 60). Behavioral plasticity was seen in subadult recruitment to coastal habitat, with some subadults maturing and recruiting before or during the spawning season and others (14 of 20 acoustically tagged fish) recruiting at the end of the 2012 spawning season. Both adults and recruited subadults (n = 29) were consequently detected in the Charlotte Harbor array, 132 km to the south. Spawning-site fidelity to the Tampa Bay spawning site occurred at both the population and individual scales. Aggregations consistently occurred in Tampa Bay coastal waters during the spawning season, and approximately two-thirds of tagged adults returned in the 2013 spawning season. A similar proportion of subadults returned to the Tampa Bay spawning site, exhibiting natal homing. However, these first-time spawners arrived later than repeat spawners and were detected over shorter time periods.

Mortality on coral reefs is intrinsically linked with predation, with most evidence suggesting that predation is highest during crepuscular periods. We tested this hypothesis using passive acoustic telemetry data to determine the time of day of potential mortality events (PMEs) of adult herbivorous reef fishes. A total of 94 fishes were tagged with acoustic transmitters, of which 43 exhibited a PME. Furthermore, we identified five categories of PMEs based on the nature of change in acoustic signal detections from tagged fishes. The majority of PMEs were characterised by an abrupt stop in detections, possibly as a result of a large, mobile predator. Overall, mortality rates were estimated to be approximately 59 % per year using passive acoustic telemetry. The time of day of PMEs suggests that predation was highest during the day and crepuscular periods and lowest at night, offering only partial support for the crepuscular predation hypothesis. Visually oriented, diurnal and crepuscular predators appear to be more important than their nocturnal counterparts in terms of predation on adult reef fishes.

We investigated movements of three species of sharks within a MCE and in relation to FSAs located on the shelf edge south of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands. Movements of 17 tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), seven lemon (Negaprion brevirostris), and six Caribbean reef (Carcharhinus perezi) sharks tagged with acoustic transmitters were monitored within the MCE using an array of acoustic receivers spanning an area of 1,060 km(2) over a five year period. Receivers were concentrated around prominent grouper FSAs to monitor movements of sharks in relation to these temporally transient aggregations. Over 130,000 detections of telemetered sharks were recorded, with four sharks tracked in excess of 3 years. All three shark species were present within the MCE over long periods of time and detected frequently at FSAs, but patterns of MCE use and orientation towards FSAs varied both spatially and temporally among species. Lemon sharks moved over a large expanse of the MCE, but concentrated their activities around FSAs during grouper spawning and were present within the MCE significantly more during grouper spawning season. Caribbean reef sharks were present within a restricted portion of the MCE for prolonged periods of time, but were also absent for long periods. Tiger sharks were detected throughout the extent of the acoustic array, with the MCE representing only portion of their habitat use, although a high degree of individual variation was observed.

Less is known, however, about the effects of marine reserves on herbivorous fish and their role on temperate reefs. This study evaluated the potential for marine reserves to enhance grazing by herbivores on temperate reefs in Jervis Bay Marine Park, Australia. First, the movement patterns of a dominant grazer, luderick Girella tricuspidata, were determined using acoustic telemetry to assess the potential effects of marine reserves on G. tricuspidata. Second, the size and abundance of G. tricuspidata and other grazers (rock blackfish Girella elevata and silver drummer Kyphosus sydneyanus) was quantified on shallow subtidal reefs inside and outside marine reserves using a diver operated stereo-video system. Finally, grazing rates were quantified inside and outside marine reserves using video cameras. Luderick G. tricuspidata exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs and was significantly larger and more abundant within marine reserves. Rock blackfish G. elevata was significantly more abundant in one of four marine reserves, although showed no difference in size between zones. Silver drummer K. sydneyanus was significantly larger in marine reserves, although not significantly more abundant. On shallow subtidal reefs, G. tricuspidata was the dominant grazer compared to other girellids and kyphosids, accounting for >97% of total algal bites (predominantly on algal turfs). Grazing rates were higher on average within marine reserves (although not significantly higher) and there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of G. tricuspidata and number of algal bites, indicating grazing intensity increased with abundance. The findings in this study demonstrate the clear potential for greater grazing by herbivores within temperate marine reserves. This study also suggests that exploitation of targeted herbivores on temperate reefs is significant and marine reserves can reduce this impact and allow it to be measured via reference areas.

Residency and movement patterns of 23 individuals were monitored for up to 28 mo, revealing different patterns between sexes and sizes. Neonate/juveniles were short-term residents; adult females were long-term residents and preliminary data suggest that adult males were vagrants. Adult females and neonate/juveniles had small activity spaces (50% kernel utilisation distribution, KUD < 5 km(2)) and shared the same habitats and locations while adult males (when present) had larger activity spaces (50% KUD up to 14 km(2)).

Recent work on sharks has shown that often only a portion of the adult population will undertake migrations, while the rest may be resident in an area for long periods. Defining the extent to which adult sharks use specific habitats and their migratory behaviour is essential for assessing their risk of exposure to threats such as fishing and habitat degradation. The present study used acoustic telemetry to examine residency patterns and migratory behaviour of adult bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) along the East coast of Australia. Fifty-six VR2W acoustic receivers were used to monitor the movements of 33 bull sharks in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Both males and females were detected year-round, but their abundance and residency peaked between September and December across years (2012-2014). High individual variability in reef use patterns was apparent, with some individuals leaving the array for long periods, whereas others (36%) exhibited medium (0.20-0.40) or high residency (>0.50). A large portion of the population (51%) undertook migrations of up to 1,400 km to other coral reefs and/or inshore coastal habitats in Queensland and New South Wales. Most of these individuals (76%) were mature females, and the timing of migrations coincided with the austral summer (Dec-Feb). All migrating individuals (except one) returned to the central GBR, highlighting its importance as a potential foraging ground. Our findings suggest that adult bull sharks appear to be highly dependent on coral reef resources and provide evidence of partial migration, where only a portion of the female population undertook seasonal migrations potentially to give birth.

We examined the residency, dispersal, degree of reef connectivity, and MPA use of grey reef (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), silvertip (C. albimarginatus), and bull (C. leucas) sharks monitored in the central Great Barrier Reef (GBR). An array of 56 acoustic receivers was used to monitor shark movements on 17 semi-isolated reefs. Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus were detected most days at or near their tagging reef. However, while C. amblyrhynchos spent 80% of monitoring days in the array, C. albimarginatus was only detected 50% of the time. Despite both species moving similar distances (<50 km), a large portion of the population of C. albimarginatus (71%) was detected on multiple reefs and moved more frequently between reefs and management zones than C. amblyrhynchos. Carcharhinus leucas was detected less than 20% of the time within the tagging array, and 42% of the population undertook long-range migrations to other arrays in the GBR. Networks derived for C. leucas were larger and more complex than those for C. amblyrhynchos and C. albimarginatus. Our findings suggest that protecting specific reefs based on prior knowledge (e.g., healthier reefs with high fish biomass) and increasing the level of protection to include nearby, closely spaced reef habitats (<20 km) may perform better for species like C. albimarginatus than having either a single or a network of isolated MPAs. This design would also provide protection for larger male C. amblyrhynchos, which tend to disperse more and use larger areas than females.

Monitoring in situ environmental parameters on coral reefs in conjunction with the movements of fishes can help explain the relationship between exploited populations and their environment. Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes. Identifying key environmental drivers that affect the distribution of reef fishes is important, and may allow managers to predict the effect of these changes on exploited species.",2015-12-01,Bruna,Included,,

Geomagnetic cues are thought to guide long-range navigation, while visual or olfactory cues allow animals to pinpoint precise locations, but the complete behavioral sequence is not yet understood. Terra Ceia Bay is a primary nursery area for blacktip sharks, Carcharhinus limbatus, on southwestern Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. Young-of-theyear animals show strong fidelity to a specific home range in the northeastern end of the bay and rapidly return when displaced. Older juveniles demonstrate annual philopatry for the first few years, migrating as far south as the Florida Keys each fall, then returning to Terra Ceia Bay each spring. To examine the sensory cues used in homing, we captured neonate (53 weeks old) blacktip sharks from within their home range, fitted them with acoustic tags, and translocated them to sites 8km away in adjacent Tampa Bay and released them. Intact animals returned to their home range, within 34 h on average, and remained there. With olfaction blocked, fewer animals returned to their home range and they took longer to do so, 130 h on average. However, they did not remain there but instead moved throughout Terra Ceia Bay and in and out of Tampa Bay. Since sharks from both treatments returned at night in tannic and turbid water, vision is likely not playing a major role in navigation by these animals. The animals in this study also returned on incoming or slack tides, suggesting that sharks, like many other fish, may use selective tidal stream transport to conserve energy and aid navigation during migration. Collectively, these results suggest that while other cues, possibly geomagnetic and/or tidal information, might guide sharks over long distances, olfactory cues are required for recognizing their specific home range.",2015-09-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

The spatial and temporal dimensions of fish behavior (movement and/or vertical migrations) are particularly relevant for rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) because most rockfish species are long-lived and have high site fidelity, increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation. In this study, we describe the short-term (with a tracking period of up to 46 d) spatial behavior, as determined by acoustic tracking, of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, a species subject to overexploitation in the Yellow Sea of China. The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) in the study area was 0.92 +/- 0.13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. Acoustic tracking also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area. However, the diel detection periodicity (24 h) was only evident for certain periods of the tracking time, as revealed by a continuous wavelet transform. The habitat selection index of tagged S. schlegelii suggested that S. schlegelii preferred natural reefs, mixed sand/artificial reef bottoms and mixed bottoms of boulder, cobble, gravel and artificial reefs. The preference of this species for the artificial reefs that were recently deployed in the study area suggests that artificial seascapes may be effective management tools to attract individuals. The vertical movement of tagged S. schlegelii was mostly characterized by bottom dwelling behavior, and there was high individual variability in the vertical migration pattern.

Twenty-nine C. amblyrhynchos were tracked for over 2 years to define movement patterns. All individuals showed high residency within the study site, but also had high roaming indices. This indicated that individuals remained in the region and used all of the monitored habitat (i.e., the entire reef perimeter). Use of space was consistent through time with high reuse of areas most of the year. Therefore, individuals maintained discrete home ranges, but undertook broader movements around the reef at times. Mature males showed greatest variation in movement with larger activity spaces and movement into new regions during the mating season (August-September). Depth use patterns also differed, suggesting behaviour or resource requirements varied between sexes. Examination of the long-term, reef-scale movements of C. amblyrhynchos has revealed that reproductive activity may play a key role in space use and activity patterns.

Barotrauma-afflicted fish may not only experience immediate mortality but also delayed mortality after returning to depth. This variability and unknown fate leads to uncertainty in stock assessment models and rebuilding plans. To generate better estimates of immediate and delayed mortality and postrelease behavior, Red Snapper were tagged with ultrasonic acoustic transmitters fitted with acceleration and depth sensors. Unique behavior profiles were generated for each fish using these sensor data that allowed the classification of survival and delayed mortality events. Using this information, we compared the survival of Red Snapper released using venting, nonventing, and descending treatments over three seasons and two depths. Red Snapper survival was highest at cooler temperatures and shallower depths. Fish released using venting and descender tools had similar survival, and both these groups of fish had higher survival than nonvented surface-released fish. Overall, Red Snapper had 72% survival, 15% immediate mortality, and 13% delayed mortality, and all fish suffering from delayed mortality perished within a 72-h period after release. Results from these field studies enhance the understanding of the delayed mortality and postrelease fate of Red Snapper regulatory discards. Moreover, these data support the practice of using venting or descender devices to increase the survival of discarded Red Snapper in the recreational fishery and show that acoustic telemetry can be a valuable tool in estimating delayed mortality.",2015-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Not habitat use,Artificial reefs,Full text checked,__EXR__Not habitat use",

Thirteen juveniles were acoustically monitored between March and December 2012, and in July 2012, four active tracks were completed. The majority of the acoustically monitored rays remained within the intertidal bay for the entire monitoring period. Tidal changes caused rays to move from the inner-bay mangrove (high tide) habitat to coral reef in the outer bay (low tide). Actively tracked rays moved in a directed way during running tides, remaining in shallow water. During periods of high and low tide, when rays refuged in mangrove or reef habitats, movement was limited and sinuosity was high. In mangrove areas, rays were most commonly observed refuging under or close to mangrove roots, and rarely in open sand areas.

Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5 +/- 0.5 km(2) compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km(2). Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending similar to 80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries.

Those species responsible for maintaining functional connectivity between habitats are often called mobile links and are regarded as essential elements of resilience. By providing connectivity, they support resilience across spatial scales. Most marine organisms, including fishes, have long-term, biogeographic-scale connectivity through larval movement. Although most reef species are highly site attached after larval settlement, some taxa may also be able to provide rapid, reef-scale connectivity as adults. On coral reefs, the identity of such taxa and the extent of their mobility are not yet known. We use acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of Kyphosus vaigiensis, one of the few reef fishes that feeds on adult brown macroalgae. Unlike other benthic herbivorous fish species, it also exhibits large-scale (> 2 km) movements. Individual K. vaigiensis cover, on average, a 2.5 km length of reef (11 km maximum) each day. These large-scale movements suggest that this species may act as a mobile link, providing functional connectivity, should the need arise, and helping to support functional processes across habitats and spatial scales. An analysis of published studies of home ranges in reef fishes found a consistent relationship between home range size and body length. K. vaigiensis is the sole herbivore to depart significantly from the expected home range-body size relationship, with home range sizes more comparable to exceptionally mobile large pelagic predators rather than other reef herbivores. While the large-scale movements of K. vaigiensis reveal its potential capacity to enhance resilience over large areas, it also emphasizes the potential limitations of small marine reserves to protect some herbivore populations.",2014-06-01,Bruna,Included,,

Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support.        On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well understood.        Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community.        Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an 'ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef.        Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs.

Mobility within this seamount increased during spring and summer, and geostrophic current speed was negatively correlated with detection probability. Overall, the acoustic telemetry results showed that adult almaco jacks were resident year-round, refuting the traditional view that these fish are essentially migratory and a seasonal occurrence in the Azores.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs.

Detectability, as expected, declines with increasing distance between tags and receivers, and we find average detection ranges of 530 and 120 m, using V16 and V13 tags, respectively, but the topography of the reef can significantly modify this relationship, reducing the range by similar to 70 %, even when tags and receivers are in line-of-sight.

Nighttime detection range was consistently reduced in both locations, and detections varied by lunar phase in the 4-month test, suggesting a strong influence of biological noise (reducing detection probability up to 30 %), notably more influential than other environmental noises, including wind-driven noise, which is normally considered important in open-water environments. Analysis of detections should be corrected in consideration of the diel patterns we find, and range tests or sentinel tags should be used for more than 1 month to quantify potential changes due to lunar phase. Some studies assume that the most usual factor limiting detection range is weather-related noise; this cannot be extrapolated to coral reefs.",2013-12-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Methodological article,__EXR__Methodological article",

Reviewed species are luderick (Girella tricuspidata), eastern rock blackfish (Girella elevata), yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis), tarwhine (Rhabdosargus sarba), snapper (Pagrus auratus), red morwong (Cheilodactylus fuscus) and eastern blue grouper (Achoerodus viridis). The species have a diverse range of life-histories and population traits, and selected parameters were well studied in several species, such as growth (blue groper, luderick, yellowfin bream, tarwhine, snapper), post-settlement movement (red morwong), and larval ecology (yellowfin bream). However, empirical data on levels of pre- and post-settlement connectivity and real-time movements are not available for most species, and this represents a significant gap for improved spatial management.

Mulloway released at high densities had faster emigration and greater overall emigration rates than low density releases.

A large number of empirical studies have focused on their effects on reef fish populations. Yet, few studies have looked at their effectiveness on semelparous species such as cephalopods, in spite of their commercial importance in many coastal regions across the globe. In this study we combine behavioural (biotelemetry) and demographic (experimental fishing) data to understand the effects of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) on local populations of cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. We used a beyond-BACI design to analyze the possible effect of the implementation of a no-take area on the abundance and biomass of this species and acoustic telemetry data to assess its site fidelity and movements within the study area. Results indicate that there was no detectable effect of the implementation of the no-take area on the abundance or biomass of cuttlefish. We found evidence that acoustically tagged adult cuttlefish leave the reserve a few days or weeks after tagging. The fact that cuttlefish have low site fidelity inside the reserve and large movements across and beyond the study area explains why there is no increase in the population inside the MPA. These results suggest that small coastal marine reserves such as the LSMP are not effective in providing long term protection to cuttlefish populations and, probably, those of other short-lived, highly mobile cephalopods.

However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i.e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics.",2013-07-30,Bruna,Included,Artificial reefs,"{""Bruna""=>[""Telemetria acústica???""]}"

Luderick exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs, tending to remain on or return consistently to the reef where they were caught and released. All eight fish actively tracked used core areas solely on their release reef, with the exception of one fish that used multiple core areas, and four of the six fish passively tracked spent between 75 to 96% of days on release reefs over the entire tracking period. Luderick did move frequently to adjacent reefs, and occasionally to more distant reefs, however consistently returned to their release reef. Luderick also exhibited predictable patterns in movement between spatially distinct daytime and night-time core use areas.

Individual cod utilized spawning areas <60 km(2) in size (mean 41 km(2)) with a high degree of spatial overlap. Activity was distributed along a roughly V-shaped ""corridor"" bounded by elevated bottom features. Cod aggregated around specific humps and ridges, and there were two separate weeks during the two-month study when the majority of cod converged on a single aggregation ""hot-spot.""

To improve this situation for reef fishes, we introduced a novel response variable method that treats signal detections as proportions (i.e., percent transmissions detected or ""detection rates"") and compared this against prior approaches to examine the influence of array and transmitter performance, signal distance and environmental factors on detection rates. We applied this method to tagged snappers and groupers in the Florida reef ecosystem and controlled range-tests on static targets in Bayboro Harbor, Florida, to provide methodological guidance for the planning and evaluation of passive array studies for coral reef fishes.        Results: Logistic regression analysis indicated detection rates were primarily a non-linear function of tag distance from receiver. A 'model-weighted' function was developed to incorporate the non-linear relationship between detection rate and distance to provide robust positioning estimates and allow for easy extension to tags with different ping rates.        Conclusions: Optimal acoustic array design requires balancing the interplay between receiver spacing, detection rates, and positioning error. Spacing receivers at twice the distance of the modeled 50% detection rate may be appropriate when quantification of overall space use is a priority, and would provide a minimum of 75% detection rate. However, for research where missing detections within the array is unacceptable or time-at-arrival based fine-scale positioning is needed, tighter receiver spacing may be required to maintain signal detection probability near 100%.",2013-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Methodological article,__EXR__Methodological article",

Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools).

Home range size did not differ significantly between day and night. Home ranges of all fish extended beyond the reserve boundaries, showing example of potential spillover into take zones. Temporal activity patterns of fish were diurnal with a dominant diel rhythm, likely due to a resting behaviour at night.

Coral reefs are no exception. However, there is a paucity of information relating to the performance of acoustic receivers on coral reefs. Our results suggest that the detection performance of acoustic receivers may be significantly impacted by the unique nature of the reef environment. This study assessed the performance of passive acoustic receivers on a typical inner-shelf fringing reef, Orpheus Island, on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The detection range and diel performance variability of acoustic receivers was assessed using two parallel lines of 5 VR2W receivers spanning 125 m, deployed on the reef base and reef crest. Two 9-mm acoustic transmitters were moored at opposite ends of each receiver line. The working detection range for receivers was found to be approximately 90 m for the transmitter moored on the reef base and just 60 m for the transmitter moored on the reef crest. However, the detection range on the reef crest increased to 90 m when just the reef crest receivers were considered, highlighting importance of optimal receiver deployment. No diel patterns in receiver performance or detection capacities were detected, suggesting that no corrections are required when interpreting nocturnal versus diurnal activity patterns. We suggest that studies aiming for complete coverage of a site within a reef environment will require receivers in close (< 100 m) proximity, and that the placement depth of receivers must be a major consideration, with shallow receivers exhibiting a greater detection range than those on the reef slope. Our results highlight the challenges imposed by coral reefs for acoustic telemetry and the importance of receiver placement for studies conducted within these habitats.",2012-09-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Methodological article,__EXR__Methodological article",

The protection of sharks at these seamounts should be an integral component of conservation plans. Therefore, knowledge on the spatial ecology of sharks at the Coral Sea seamounts is essential for the appropriate implementation of management and conservation plans.

Most individuals showed year round residency at Osprey Reef, although five of the 49 individuals tagged moved to the neighbouring Shark Reef (similar to 14 km away) and one grey reef shark completed a round trip of similar to 250 km to the Great Barrier Reef. Additionally, individuals of white tip and grey reef sharks showed strong site fidelity to the areas they were tagged, and there was low spatial overlap between groups of sharks tagged at different locations. Spatial use at Osprey Reef by adult sharks is generally restricted to the north-west corner.

A series of acoustic receivers deployed throughout south-eastern Tasmania as well as a receiver array along an isolated reef, Crayfish Point Reserve (CPR), passively tracked 25 C. laticeps from January to July 2003. Cephaloscyllium laticeps were present from 4 to 98 days. The majority of the C. laticeps stayed within the CPR where most individuals were active throughout the night. They were found actively moving (i.e. when a C. laticeps was consecutively detected by two or more non-overlapping receivers, suggesting the individual was moving) and spending periods of minor movements (i.e. when an individual was consecutively detected by only one receiver, suggesting it was at rest). The length of these minor movements periods, observed both day and night, ranged from 1 h to 5 days. In addition to passive tracking, 1552 conventionally tagged C. laticeps were released in the eastern and south-western coastal areas of Tasmania and within the CPR between January 2000 and April 2007. The CPR showed a higher recapture rate, 38%, than eastern and south-western areas where the recapture rates were 10 and 3%, respectively. Within the CPR, 36% of the sharks were recaptured on multiple occasions. The maximum time at liberty ranged from 1 month to 7 years. The majority of the C. laticeps were recaptured in the vicinity of where they were released (<10 km), although larger longer-term movements of up to 300 km were recorded. The large amount of multiple recaptures within the CPR, in addition to acoustic tagging results, indicated a high degree of site fidelity for C. laticeps.

The direct benefit of this protection, the so called 'reserve effect', is the build-up of biomass through an increase in individual numbers and size. This effect can take several years depending on the life history traits of the target species. However, empirical studies on individual fish spatial behaviour at temporal scales long enough to be compatible with that of invoking the reserve effect are still virtually lacking. We studied the inter-annual patterns of habitat use of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), an endangered reef fish predator, using passive acoustic telemetry inside and around a small marine reserve in the Azores, mid-north Atlantic. All 11 individuals resided in the reserve year-round for up to 5 years. During these periods, fish were detected nearly every day and utilised stable core activity areas. Two smaller fish apparently abandoned the area after some time, probably relocating outside the reserve. Our results indicate that even small marine reserves can promote the long-term recovery of some endangered species if the long-term behaviour (i.e. site fidelity) of individuals is appropriate.

Plasticity of diel activity rhythm in a tropical reef fish, Siganus lineatus","1. In studies of an organism's functional ecology, key behavioural traits such as foraging periodicity are assumed to be uniform across the species. In particular, the fundamental division between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns is usually assumed to be a fixed one, with organisms demonstrating physiological traits optimised for a particular diel rhythm.        2. In this study, we explore the activity rhythm of a tropical reef fish, the golden-lined rabbitfish, Siganus lineatus. We make use of acoustic telemetry (manual tracking), combined with underwater observations of feeding behaviour to investigate the diel foraging patterns of S. lineatus, at three sites around the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef.        3. We found significant differences in the activity patterns of shoreline and reef-based populations of S. lineatus. Individuals inhabiting the boulder-shoreline site foraged during the day and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the two reef populations foraged only during nocturnal hours, remaining stationary at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish.        4. We suggest that S. lineatus is a diurnal nominal herbivore whose biological rhythm has developed the flexibility to be nocturnal. This development may simply represent the masking effects of predation, competition or ontogeny, or it may represent entrainment over an evolutionary time-scale necessary to enable the species to expand its range into the coral reef environment.        5. Either way, the results identify S. lineatus as a potential subject for research into the relative importance of the various biological forces driving divisions along the temporal niche axis and suggest that the species has the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at the ecological and evolutionary level.",2011-10-01,Bruna,Included,,

Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas.

Temporal patterns and fish position were determined using a fixed-receiver array located in a marine protected area (MPA) in Palma Bay (Balearic Islands). Fish position as centre of activity (COA, the centre of the area the fish uses during a specific time) and space utilisation preferences could be described due to a receiver array design with a high range detection overlap (more densely distributed near the COA). There were significantly more detections per time unit during the day, which was interpreted as increased activity possibly related to feeding habits and social behaviour. S. cabrilla spent 95% of its time in an average area of 0.77 +/- 0.17 km(2), with a core area (50% of the time) of 0.10 +/- 0.29 km(2). The home range size was not related to fish size or diel pattern (i.e. the size of the daytime home range was not significantly different from the night range). The linearity index and the index of reuse (proxies of site fidelity) also demonstrated that this species has high site fidelity, which suggests that it is sedentary with a limited adult dispersal capacity.

To address this knowledge gap, we coupled hydro-acoustic technology to track fish with seafloor mapping and pattern analysis techniques from landscape ecology to quantify seascape structure. Bluestriped grunts Haemulon sciurus and schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus were tracked over 24 h periods using boat-based acoustic telemetry.

For both fish species, night activity spaces were significantly larger than day activity spaces. Fish exhibited a daytime preference for seascapes with aggregate coral reef and colonized bedrock, then shifted to night activity spaces with lower-complexity soft sediment including sand, seagrass, and scattered coral/rock. Movement path complexity was negatively correlated with seascape complexity. This demonstrates direct connectivity across multiple patch types and represents the first study to apply quantitative landscape ecology techniques to examine the movement ecology of marine fish.

We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, north-eastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types.

Diel, seasonal and inter-annual movements of trevally were studied using active acoustic tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-release in the Faial Channel, Azores Islands. White trevally were captured at inshore and offshore reefs. Inshore trevally moved daily alongshore, using large activity spaces, while the short-term movements of offshore trevally were restricted to the reef summits. During the summer spawning season, both groups displayed frequent migrations of up to several kilometres, but inshore fish remained inshore, whereas offshore reef fish expanded their range to include visits to inshore sites. This behaviour eventually resulted in low long-term residence within the study area, especially that of inshore fish. During the spawning season, one inshore site was visited by most of the fish. However, instead of gathering in large aggregations at a single location, it appears that the trevally adopted a multiple-site visiting behaviour, which may increase mating opportunities through mixing between inshore and offshore fish that are otherwise segregated for most of the year. Protection of spawning biomass and sites for this species seems potentially feasible, but this would require protecting a suite of sites per island.

The increasing use of acoustic telemetry techniques, particularly passive acoustic arrays, is providing much of that information, but studies have typically used one specific approach at a specific spatial-temporal scale. We studied movement patterns, habitat use and dispersal in the red porgy, Pagrus pagrus (a commercially important species) in the Azores islands, mid-north Atlantic, with the aim of supporting the design of marine reserves that would protect local populations while enhancing fisheries. Movements were quantified using: (1) short-term active acoustic tracking; (2) multi-year passive acoustic monitoring; and (3) standard tag-release experiments in the Faial Channel. We found the short-term home ranges of red porgy to be quite large for a reef fish - up to 50 ha. Further-more, frequent short-term displacements of up to 9 km and periodic absences from main core activity areas indicate that HR varies considerably in size and location throughout the year. Home range expansion occurred mostly during the protracted period of spawning activity, but we saw no evidence for spawning aggregations. We found evidence that individuals of smaller size utilize larger home ranges and are less site-specific, supporting the hypothesis that dispersal in the red porgy is largely determined by ontogenic changes. Large individual variability in both short-term and long-term movement patterns accounted for some emigrations from tagging sites and for one documented relocation. These findings indicate that adequate protection of subpopulations of red porgy will not be achieved using small, isolated reserves (1 to 5 km(2)), but reserves of size in the order of tens of km(2) and spaced a few kilometers apart should provide protection while promoting emigration (spillover) of red porgy from reserves to neighboring grounds.

No inter-atoll movements by uku were detected but individuals were seasonally site-attached to core activity areas of up to 12 km in length, and ranged up to 19 km across atolls. Within their core areas, tagged uku exhibited diel and tidal habitat shifts, with the latter resulting in round trips of up to 24 km in 24 h. Seasonal uku migrations resulted in extended winter (October-April) absences from summer (May-September) core activity areas and may be linked to summer spawning. Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries. However, this would still require relatively large MPAs (12 km in length) to contain uku short-term (diel and tidal) movements, and seasonal migrations would still take uku beyond the boundaries of MPAs of this size. These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.",2007-07-01,Bruna,Included,MPA,

An understanding of the spatial dynamics of these fishes is critical for fisheries management and conservation. However, movements and migration dynamics of endangered reef fishes are poorly known. We show, using acoustic telemetry, that Nassau groupers Epinephelus striatus exhibit highly synchronised migration to spawning sites, despite their otherwise solitary habits. Reproductive adults leave their individual territories in shallow waters near the winter full moons, and migrate to the same spawning site up to 4 times yr(-1). At the spawning site, a remarkable population-wide depth change occurs within an hour as individuals dive to a maximum depth of 255 m. Our results greatly expand the previously known migration frequency and depth range of this species, and reveal an unexpected yet predictable complexity of adult fish migration between habitats.

We used acoustic telemetry to quantify the movements of giant trevally, a large coral reef top predator, at 5 atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument. We did not observe any inter-atoll movements but found that giant trevally were attached to core activity areas from which they made periodic atoll-wide excursions of up to 29 km. Within the core areas, the tagged fish exhibited diel habitat shifts. We identified Rapture Reef at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll as a spawning site, where giant trevally form seasonal mating aggregations. Giant trevally that use Rapture Reef as their core daytime area live there year-round, whereas those that occupy other areas of FFS migrate to Rapture Reef in the summertime during specific phases of the moon. Although giant trevally were wide-ranging and would require large marine protected areas (e.g. entire atolls or islands) to protect their entire range, core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally could be contained within relatively small marine protected areas. Identification of spawning sites could assist in the establishment of focused marine protected areas that, while quite small in size, could have significant impact in preserving the spawning biomass of this species. Very large marine protected areas are not feasible in most heavily populated areas, hence effective alternative management strategies must be found for this tishery-targeted, wide-ranging top predator. We suggest using a combination of relatively small marine protected areas, to protect core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally, and conventional measures such as minimum size or 'slot' limits to further safeguard spawning stocks.",2007-01-01,Bruna,Included,,

Using individual-based models, the movement networks of two sympatric shark species were efficiently predicted with distance-decay functions (>95% movements accurately predicted). Model outliers were used to highlight the locations with unexpectedly high movement rates where MPA enforcement patrols might most efficiently mitigate predator removal. Activity space estimates and network metrics illustrate that silvertip sharks were more dynamic, less resident and link larger components of the MPA than grey reef sharks. However, we show that this behaviour potentially enhances their exposure to illegal fishing activity. Synthesis and applications. Marine protected area (MPA) enforcement strategies are often limited by resources. The British Indian Ocean Territory MPA, one of the world's largest 'no take' MPAs, has a single patrol vessel to enforce 640,000 km(2)of open ocean, atoll and reef ecosystems. We argue that to optimize the patrol vessel search strategy and thus enhance their protective capacity, ecological data on the space use and movements of desirable species, such as large-bodied reef predators, must be incorporated into management plans. Here, we use electronic tracking data to evaluate how shark movement dynamics influence species mortality trajectories in exploited reef ecosystems. In doing so we discuss how network analyses of such data might be applied for protected area enforcement.",2020-09-01,Bruna,Excluded,"MPA,Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators, but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated. We used results of acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analyses to investigate the diel and seasonal movements of Galapagos sharks Carcharhinus galapagensis and giant trevally Caranx ignobilis captured from a mesophotic reef (depth: 50 to 70 m) at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. All predators associated with mesophotic reefs performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements, diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) and others performing reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the summer spawning periods. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to their variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra- specific competition. Mesophotic reefs may provide some prey to upper level predators but also serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients, particularly from shallow to mesophotic reefs.",2015-02-17,Bruna,Included,Elasmo,

Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation.        ResultsA total of 0%, 17.9% and 34.7% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area.        Main conclusionsExpansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators.",2016-05-01,Bruna,Excluded,"MPA,Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

The critically endangered hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) spends an extended part of its juvenile development in coastal waters. A strong proclivity to remain resident in small areas, often in high density, raises questions about how juveniles partition resources including selection of habitat and spatial overlap among conspecifics. Using between 36 and 41 acoustic receivers in the 1.5 km(2) study site, this study quantified day-and-night habitat selection, as well as 2D and 3D space use of 23 juvenile hawksbills within two adjacent Caribbean foraging grounds-Brewers Bay and Hawksbill Cove, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands-between 2015 and 2018. We found that coral reef, rock, and the artificial dolosse forming an airport runway, were the most strongly selected habitats based on resource selection indices. Individual activity spaces in 2D and 3D were both larger during the day compared to night, although the same parts of the bay were used by each individual during both periods.

We used an array of 28 acoustic receivers within a complex mosaic of seagrass patches, bare sand, mangrove forests and deep-water channels and used regression tree analyses to determine which spatial, temporal and protection factors contributed most to G. typus habitat use. Overall, 50% of the total detections in the study occurred inside marine reserves containing large seagrass beds (>7.09 m(2)) and in close proximity to mangroves (<7.47 km). During winter (<20.2 degrees C), G. typus centre of activity increased significantly (p < 0.001), and greater than 50% of the detections occurred in reserves in winter. Conversely, during the rest of the year (water temperature > 20.2 degrees C), the habitat use of individuals is contained in smaller centres of activity compared with winter, however, protection effects varied. Our results show that seascape context and marine reserves combine to provide the optimal areas for G. typus habitat selection. Limited food resources likely caused larger centres of activity during winter. Identifying priority habitats for vulnerable species is critical for ongoing protection and maintaining effective conservation initiatives.

In coral reefs, pelagic nutrient subsidies are believed to play an increasingly important role under ongoing and projected environmental changes. Here, we combine visual sightings with passive acoustic monitoring to report habitat use and behaviour by cetaceans within atoll lagoons in the Maldives and Chagos archipelagoes. We demonstrate that spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) are the most widely distributed and numerically abundant cetacean inside these atolls (>90% of all individual cetaceans by numbers). Our visual and acoustic observations both provide evidence of a regular diurnal behaviour, where dolphins enter the lagoons during the morning, for day-time resting, and exit during the afternoon, for night-time foraging offshore. Using standard metabolic models and timing of lagoonal residencies, we estimate that a dolphin pod would deposit approximately 288 +/- 17 kg year(-1) of nitrogen of primarily mesopelagic origin inside the lagoons. The nitrogen deposited inside an atoll lagoon by a dolphin pod resident year-round will therefore likely enhance coral reef productivity and resilience and suggests that these dolphins play a role in making pelagic energy and nutrients available to coral reefs.

Females moved into male territories during evening hours to spawn. Male courtship behaviours targeted a single female, included head shakes and burst rises and preceded pair spawning prior to sunset. Males and females displayed three shared colour phases, but four phases were sex-specific. During evening hours, courtship and spawning, both sexes exhibited sexual dichromatism concurrent with reproductive behaviours. The pair-spawning mating system and observations of bimodal size distributions by sex support previous claims of protogyny in the species.

Unicornfish were resident within the MR where they spent most time in reef crest habitat with occasional, brief forays into reef flat habitat. We confirmed unicornfish consume G. salicornia and found a significant positive correlation between algal canopy height and distance from the reef crest, presumably because grazing intensity is lower in less frequently utilized reef flat habitat.

As part of the Grouper Moon Project, we acoustically tagged ten spawning male Tiger Grouper at the western end of Little Cayman in February 2015.

Fish began aggregating 2 days before the full moon and left 10-12 days after the full moon, from January to May. Regardless of migratory strategy, all tagged fish that aggregated after February 2015 returned to the west end FSA. However, in January 2016, one fish appeared to attend a different FSA closer to its presumed home territory.

Monitoring post-translocation movements and migration provides useful information to inform translocation strategies. Three species of large-bodied fish (Yellowfin Bream Acanthopagrus australis, Luderick Girella tricuspidata, and Tarwhine Rhabdosargus sarba) impounded in a cooling water canal at a power station were translocated into the adjacent estuary (Lake Macquarie, New South Wales). Translocated fish were tagged with acoustic tags ( equipped with accelerometer sensors (providing a relative measure of fish activity) and released on either an artificial reef or a natural reef.

Fish were tracked throughout Lake Macquarie on a dispersed array of 18 VemcoVR2W receivers, and on the artificial reef using a VR4-UWM Vemco Positioning System, for up to 11 months. Yellowfin Bream and Luderick rapidly migrated back to the power station, whereas Tarwhine remained near the release location. Translocated Yellowfin Bream showed divergent behavioural patterns to free-ranging Yellowfin Bream on the artificial reef, with much higher activity levels, elevated nocturnal activity, and different patterns of habitat usage, possibly reflecting divergent foraging behaviour.

Thus the rise in acoustic energy associated with increasing human activity in the ocean has potential to impact the lives of marine animals. Thirty years ago marine bioacoustics primarily focused on evaluating effects of human-generated sound on hearing and behavior by testing captive animals and visually observing wild animals. Since that time rapidly changing electronic and computing technologies have yielded three tools that revolutionized how bioacousticians study marine animals. These tools are (1) portable systems for measuring electrophysiological auditory evoked potentials, (2) miniaturized tags equipped with positioning sensors and acoustic recording devices for continuous short-term acoustical observation rather than intermittent visual observation, and (3) passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) systems for remote long-term acoustic observations at specific locations. The beauty of these breakthroughs is their direct applicability to wild animals in natural habitats rather than only to animals held in captivity. Hearing capabilities of many wild species including polar bears, beaked whales, and reef fishes have now been assessed by measuring their auditory evoked potentials. Miniaturized acoustic tags temporarily attached to an animal to record its movements and acoustic environment have revealed the acoustic foraging behavior of sperm and beaked whales. Now tags are being adapted to fishes in effort to understand their behavior in the presence of noise. Moving and static PAM systems automatically detect and characterize biological and physical features of an ocean area without adding any acoustic energy to the environment. PAM is becoming a powerful technique for understanding and managing marine habitats. This paper will review the influence of these transformative tools on the knowledge base of marine bioacoustics and elucidation of relationships between marine animals and their acoustic environment, leading to a new, rapidly growing field of marine acoustic ecology.",2012-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,Review article,Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

The guns were fired once/min for eight periods on four days at different positions. The structure and intensity of the sound of each triple G. gun explosion was recorded and calibrated, Peak sound pressure levels of 210 dB (rel to 1 mu Pa) at 16 m range and 195 dB (rel to 1 mu Pa) at 109m range were measured at positions where the fish were being observed. The final position of the triple G. gun, at 5.3 m range, had a peak pressure level of 218 dB (rel to 1 mu Pa). Neither the fish, nor the invertebrates, showed any signs of moving away from the reef. Firing the guns did not interrupt a diurnal rhythm of fish gathering at dusk and passing the TV camera position while the guns were firing. The longterm day-to-night movements of two tagged pollack were slightly changed by the arrival and banging of the guns particularly when positioned within 10 m of their normal living positions. Those reef fish, watched by the TV camera, always showed involuntary reactions in the form of a Mauthner cell reflex, C-start, at each explosion of the guns at all ranges tested (maximum range was 109 m, 195 dB rel to 1 mu Pa). When the explosion source was not visible to the fish, the C-start reaction was cut short and the fish continued with what they were doing before the stimulus. When the G. gun rack was sunk to the seabed (depth 14m) visible to the fish and the TV camera, those fish that were observed approaching the G. gun rack when the guns were fired were seen to turn and flee from the very visible explosion. When the gun rack was suspended midwater (5 In depth) and just outside visible range at 16 metres, the fish receiving a 6 ms peak to peak, 206dB (rel to 1 mu Pa) pressure swing exhibited a C-start and then continued to swim towards the gun position, their intended swimming track apparently unaltered.

There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait.

Over a six month period, we captured 38 wild adult great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), a species commonly associated with ciguatera in The Bahamas. We sampled three tissues (i.e., muscle, liver, and blood) and analysed them for the presence of ciguatoxins using a functional in vitro N2A bioassay. Detectable concentrations of ciguatoxins found in the three tissue types ranged from 2.51 to 211.74 pg C-CTX-1 equivalents/g. Blood and liver toxin concentrations were positively correlated (rho = 0.86, P = 0.003), indicating that, for the first time, blood sampling provides a non-lethal method of detecting ciguatoxin in wild fish. Non-lethal blood sampling also presents opportunities to couple this approach with biotelemetry and biologging techniques that enable the study of fish distribution and movement. To demonstrate the potential for linking ciguatoxin occurrence with barracuda spatial ecology, we also present a proof-of-concept case study where blood samples were obtained from 20 fish before releasing them with acoustic transmitters and tracking them in the coastal waters using a fixed acoustic telemetry array covering 44 km(2).

Results presented from this study may help identify high risk areas and source-sink dynamics of toxins, potentially reducing the incidence and human health risk of ciguatera fish poisoning. Moreover, development of the non-lethal sampling approach and measurement of ciguatera from blood provide future opportunities to understand the mechanistic relationship between toxins and the spatial ecology of a broad range of marine fish species.

Only 3 to 23% of hatchlings encountered predators at a second study site nearby where there was no jetty and a similar amount of nesting activity. Evidence for predation was provided by rapid tag detachment due to prey handling by a predator or the extensive movement of the tags within the receiver array suggesting that the tag (and hatchling) was inside the stomach of a predator. We found that 70% of the fish predators that consumed tags used the jetty as a refuge during the day and expanded their range along nearshore waters at night, predating on hatchlings in areas adjacent to the jetty with the highest nesting density. Sampling of potential predators including lutjanid reef fishes under the jetty revealed the presence of turtle hatchlings in their gut contents.

We used a combination of laboratory and field approaches to study the thermal biology of bonefish, Albula vulpes, a fish species that relies on nearshore intertidal habitats throughout the Caribbean. The critical thermal maximum (CTMax) for bonefish was determined to be 36.4 +/- 0.5 and 37.9 +/- 0.5 degrees C for fish acclimated to 27.3 +/- 1.3 and 30.2 +/- 1.4 degrees C, respectively, and these tolerances are below maximal temperatures recorded in the tropical tidal habitats where bonefish frequently reside (i.e., up to 40.6 degrees C). In addition, daily temperatures can fluctuate up to 11.4 degrees C over a 24-h period emphasizing the dramatic range of temperatures that could be experienced by bonefish on a diel basis. Use of an acoustic telemetry array to monitor bonefish movements coupled with hourly temperature data collected within tidal creeks revealed a significant positive relationship between the amount of time bonefish spent in the upper portions of the creeks with the increasing maximal water temperature. This behavior is likely in response to feeding requirements necessary to fuel elevated metabolic demands when water temperatures generally warm, and also to avoid predators. For fish held in the laboratory, reaching CTMax temperatures elicited a secondary stress response that included an increase in blood lactate, glucose, and potassium levels. A field study that involved exposing fish to a standardized handling stressor at temperatures approaching their CTMax generated severe physiological disturbances relative to fish exposed to the same stressor at cooler temperatures. In addition, evaluation of the short-term survival of bonefish after surgical implantation of telemetry tags revealed that there was a positive relationship between water temperature at time of tagging and mortality. Collectively, the data from these laboratory and field studies suggest that bonefish occupy habitats that approach their laboratory-determined CTMax and can apparently do so without significant sub-lethal physiological consequences or mortality, except when exposed to additional stressors.

An integrative analysis of body composition and acoustic telemetry data showed that there is a positive relationship between pre-migration lipid density and duration away from the resident area for migration and reproduction (duration away). These results indicate that fatter males with higher lipid density spent longer periods outside of the resident area, which may enhance the susceptibility of these individuals to intensive fishing pressure at the FSA site.

Comparatively less is known about the ecology of these fishes, particularly in temperate systems. For instance, the extent to which gender mediates behavior within and among species, and precisely which behaviors are mediated remains unclear for many species. The California (CA) sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher [Labridae]), is a protogynous hermaphrodite found on rocky reefs and in kelp forests along the west coast of North America. Previous studies have shown significant variation in life history characteristics of CA sheephead across the southern portion of its range. In the present study, the movement behavior of 45 adult CA sheephead (26 initial phase [Iph] females and 19 terminal phase [Tph] males) was monitored for 2.5 years by an array of acoustic receivers deployed around Anacapa Island in the northern Channel Islands (California). Results clearly indicated that patterns in the movement of CA sheephead at Anacapa Island were mediated by fish gender. Tph males and Iph females differed significantly with respect to several important behavioral metrics recorded by the passive acoustic receiver array. Further, these results also differed from previous telemetric research conducted at Catalina Island (approximately 102 km to the southeast of the study area), suggesting that the vagility of CA sheephead, like other life history characteristics, changes with local environmental conditions.",2010-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Mixed habitats,Not habitat use,Artificial reefs,Full text checked,__EXR__Not habitat use",

Nine fish were tracked on coral reef habitats off La Parguera, Puerto Rico, April-May 1989. Combined distances traversed and acoustic contact time for all nine were 3.6 km and 117.5 h, respectively. Total contact times ranged from 8-20 h per individual; two fish exhibited behaviours considered to be dusk/dawn migrations in three episodes for distances of 100-530 m; two episodes were probably associated with nocturnal foraging. One fish transferred 1 km from one reef to another and did not return across deep water to its home reef. Five fish were tracked on patch reef habitats surrounded by seagrass meadows in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, Florida, May-June 1990. Combined distances and contact time were 2.8 km and 71.5 h, respectively. Total contact times ranged from 6.5 to 17.5 h per individual; three fish exhibited behaviours considered to be dusk/dawn migrations in seven episodes for distances of 130-560 m; five of these episodes were probably related to nocturnal foraging and two were between patch reefs. One individual displaced to seagrass meadow 290 m from its daytime resting patch reef, 'homed' directly back to its capture site within 30 min of release. In Puerto Rico and Florida the majority of contacts were categorized as sedentary or roaming, the latter being meandering movements usually within 100 m of the animal's apparent home within each reef complex. Movements of adult white grunt differed from published accounts of juveniles with respect to timing and frequency; off-reef migrations were initiated at irregular times and did not occur as regularly as those in younger fish, yet the essential character of nocturnal or crepuscular migration was maintained, suggesting that a significant behavioural change takes place with increasing size or maturity. The scales and swimming speeds of nocturnal foraging migrations were of the same orders of magnitude as in juveniles. Implications for fishery stock assessments are discussed.

The present study aims to compare sound-producing mechanisms in different Holocentridae genera (Holocentrus, Myripristis, Neoniphon, Sargocentron) from separate regions and, in some cases, at different developmental stages. An accurate comparison was made by recording six species while being hand-held, by observing TEM) the sonic muscles and by dissections of the sound-producing mechanism.        Results: In all these species, calls presented harmonics, their dominant frequency was between 80 and 130 Hz and they were composed of trains of 4 to 11 pulses with gradual increasing periods towards the end of the call. In each case, the calls did not provide reliable information on fish size. The sounds were produced by homologous fast-contracting sonic muscles that insert on articulated ribs whose proximal heads are integrated into the swimbladder: each pulse is the result of the back and forth movements of the ribs. Small differences in the shape of the oscillograms of the different species could be related to the number of ribs that are involved in the sound-producing mechanism. These fish species are able to make sounds as soon as they settle on the reef, when they are 40 days old. Comparison between Neoniphon from Madagascar and from Rangiroa in French Polynesia showed a new, unexpected kind of dialect involving differences at the level of pulse distribution. Neoniphon calls were characterised by a single pulse that was isolated at the beginning of the remaining train in Madagascar whereas they did not show any isolated single pulses at the beginning of the call in Rangiroa.        Conclusion: This family cannot use the acoustic fundamental frequencies (or pulse periods) of grunts to infer the size of partners. Pulse duration and number of pulses are statistically related to fish size. However, these characteristics are poorly informative because the correlation slope values are weak. It remains other features (sound amplitude, resistance to muscle fatigue, calling frequency) could be used to assess the body size. Characteristics of the sound producing mechanisms are conservative. All species possess fast-contracting muscles and have the same kind of sound producing mechanism. They do show some change between clades but these differences are not important enough to deeply modify the waveforms of the calls. In this case, our description of the grunt could be considered as the signature for the holocentrid family and can be used in passive acoustic monitoring.",2011-05-24,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

For instance, reef shark species are thought to benefit from marine protected area networks, even though their movement behaviour remains poorly characterized. Poor understanding of species' movements implies that the benefits of MPA networks for species' populations are still widely unknown. To understand the consequences of movement behaviour for protection, we modelled movements of three reef shark species' (Carcharhinus albimarginatus,C. amblyrhynchosandC. leucas) with distinct levels of reef association using real passive-acoustic telemetry data. The model simulates if individuals are protected or unprotected by their movements in a system of reef patches in a network of MPAs. Model parameters that control individuals' movements were estimated from acoustic telemetry data. To estimate benefits for species we monitored longevity and time spent in protected habitats across all scenarios of reef protection, fishing intensity (11 values for each) and protection of high or low suitability reefs (a reef-dependent factor that attracts sharks to reside in it) for populations of 1,000 individuals per species. The time individuals spent in protected reefs increased linearly with protection until it levelled off after 50%-80% of reefs protected (78%C. amblyrhynchos, 72%C. albimarginatusand 52% C. leucas, at 100% protection). Individuals' life span decreased exponentially with fishing intensity. Reef protection only mildly counteracted life span lost to fishing. Protecting highly suitable reefs increased time spent in protected reefs, optimal protection was reached at a lower number of reefs protected, and life expectancy was higher with protection of highly suitable reefs. Synthesis and applications. Our framework can be applied to many studies using passive-acoustic telemetry to track animal movements. Protected area networks benefit species highly attached to protected sites. To increase benefits of marine protected area networks for all species (with low and high degrees of reef attachment) we need to understand the use of reef-adjacent areas, dispersal routes and characterize reef suitability for multiple species.",2020-10-01,Bruna,Excluded,"MPA,Elasmo,__EXR__Elasmo",

The variable performance of acoustic telemetry equipment and ability of receivers to detect signals from transmitters have been well studied in marine and coral reef environments to inform study design and improve data interpretation. Despite the growing use of acoustic telemetry in large, deep, freshwater systems, detection efficiency and range, particularly in relation to environmental variation, are poorly understood. We used an array of 90 69-kHz acoustic receivers and 8 sentinel range transmitters of varying power output deployed at different depths and locations approximately 100-9500 m apart for 215 days to evaluate how the detection efficiency of acoustic receivers varied spatially and temporally in relation to environmental conditions.ResultsThe maximum distance that tags were detected ranged from 5.9 to 9.3 km. Shallow tags consistently had lower detection efficiency than deep tags of the same power output and detection efficiency declined through the winter months (December-February) of the study. In addition to the distance between tag and receiver, thermocline strength, surface water velocity, ice thickness, water temperature, depth range between tag and receiver, and number of fish detections contributed to explaining variation in detection efficiency throughout the study period. Furthermore, the most significant models incorporated interactions between several environmental variables and tag-receiver distance, demonstrating the complex temporal and spatial relationships that exist in heterogeneous environments.ConclusionsRelying on individual environmental variables in isolation to interpret receiver performance, and thus animal behaviour, may be erroneous when detection efficiency varies across distances, depths, or tag types. As acoustic telemetry becomes more widely used to study ecology and inform management, it is crucial to understand its limitations in heterogeneous environments, such as freshwater lakes, to improve the quality and interpretation of data. We recommend that in situ range testing and retrospective analysis of detection efficiency be incorporated into study design for telemetry projects. Furthermore, we caution against oversimplifying the dynamic relationship between detection efficiency and environmental conditions for the sake of producing a correction that can be applied directly to detection data of tagged animals when the intended correction may not be justified.",2019-09-14,Bruna,Excluded,"Freshwater,Other habitats,__EXR__Other habitats",

At the United Kingdom's largest longline mussel farm, we assessed the potential for the farm to improve the habitat suitability for commercially important crustaceans. Modelled distribution patterns (GAM & GLM) predicted the low complexity seabed beneath the mussel farm was 34-94 % less suitable for European lobster (Homarus gammarus) and brown crab (Cancer pagurus) than nearby rocky reefs. The mussel farm operations, however, contributed large amounts of living mussels and shell material to the seabed. Acoustic telemetry revealed that H.gammarus remained within the farm for between 2 and 283 days using both the farm anchors and areas of seabed dominated by fallen mussels for refuge. In contrast, C. pagurus movements showed no affinity to either the farm infrastructure or benthic habitat under the farm. Stable isotope analysis indicated a high dietary niche overlap in C. pagurus and H. gammarus (67.8 and 84.6 %) between the mussel farm (mixed muddy sediment) and nearby rocky reef. Our mixed-methods suggest that the mussel farm augments structural complexity on the seabed providing refuge and similar feeding opportunities for lobster and crab as their typical habitat on rocky reefs.

Higher movement rates during storms were due to increased mobility at night, and emigrations typically occurred at night in the direction of deeper water. Overall, we found significant storm effects on the movement behavior of a demersal fish species in the open ocean, despite our study occurring in deeper water than previous studies that have examined storm effects on animal movement.

Given that settlement habitat for juveniles is inshore seagrass / hardbottom and reproductive habitat is offshore coral reefs, dispersal during ontogeny serves as a bottleneck potentially limiting adult population density. Previous studies have examined factors associated with movement and den selection by juvenile lobsters such as shelter type, predators, and conspecific density. Their attraction to odors of healthy conspecifics plays a significant role in aggregation of lobsters in casitas and traps. But what is unknown is whether juvenile lobsters possess the map and compass orientation found in adults. To examine the ontogeny of homing ability, we conducted multiple mark / displace tracking studies using acoustic telemetry in juvenile hardbottom and subadult coral patch reef habitats. All lobsters regardless of size tend to relocate to new crevice shelters when handled, even if returned to their original shelter. Thus, for non-displaced lobsters tagged and returned to their point of capture, distance and angle travelled appears to be random with distance increasing as function of body size. However, for juvenile and subadult lobsters tagged and displaced away from their point of capture, the distance and angle travelled when released is significantly directed toward the point of capture. Thus, it appears that the map and compass ability of Caribbean spiny lobsters appears early in ontogeny and may allow for individuals to safely explore unfamiliar locations while retaining knowledge of how to return to known shelter. This ability to expand their known habitat map while maintaining knowledge of critical diurnal shelter locations is expected to facilitate their ontogenetic dispersal to adult habitat.",2024-11-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Non-fish species,__EXR__Non-fish species",

We postulate that sound-dependent species select and occupy habitats with unique acoustic characteristics that are essential to their functional needs and conducive to the threshold of sound frequency they produce and detect. These acoustic habitats are based on the composition of biophony, geophony, and technophony in the soundscape and on the biosemiotics mechanisms described in the eco-field hypothesis.

The authors compared six previously published methods for externally attaching acoustic transmitters to fish in a tank holding experiment with black sea bass Centropristis striata (L.). They tracked tag retention, fish growth and external trauma (as a measure of fish welfare) for 60 days. For each of these metrics, the results showed a wide range of responses among tagging treatments. A simple attachment method using a spaghetti tag passed through the dorsal musculature of the fish and tied to the end cap of the transmitter emerged as the preferred option based on high retention, no impact on growth and relatively low detriment to fish welfare. Future field studies using external electronic tagging should consider tag-related effects that could compromise results when selecting a method for tag attachment.",2022-09-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Methodological article,__EXR__Methodological article",

The temporal and spatial predictability of these migrations and spawning aggregation locations makes species vulnerable to overfishing, as the majority of an adult population within a large region may be harvested quickly with minimal effort. Historically, the Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus (Bloch, 1792), was an important fishery species throughout its range, but due to spawning aggregation overfishing, it is now rare in many reef ecosystems. In The Bahamas, stocks continue to decline despite the implementation of spawning aggregation protections. While more Nassau grouper spawning aggregations have been reported in The Bahamas than any other country, very few have been validated, and the dynamics of spawning migrations to and from these sites is poorly understood. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to describe, for the first time, Nassau grouper migrations along Andros Island, The Bahamas, which is bordered by one of the longest barrier reefs in the world. We report the likely extirpation of a historically important spawning aggregation and suggest Nassau grouper are migrating to a previously undocumented spawning location. Fish migrated in groups during the January 2015 full moon along the barrier reef shelf edge traveling roundtrip distances of 71.5-260.3 km [(x) over bar = 164.5 (SD 65.7) km, n = 9].

Here, we examined the effect of temperature and other environmental factors on spawning-related chorusing behaviour in the meagre Argyrosomus regius. Using an automatic recognition system based on hidden Markov models coupled with one-third octave band sound level analysis, we extracted meagre daily vocal activity over 4 yr of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) in the Tagus estuary (Portugal). Meagre vocal activity showed a distinct diel pattern, with choruses being most prevalent at dusk. Chorus activity started earlier in years with warmer springs, while the end of the season was concurrent with the rise in water temperature. Circa 70% of daily variations were explained by changes in water temperature. Tidal cycle, lunar phase and changes in daylength did not appear to affect vocal behaviour. Choruses were detected on days with mean water temperature ranging from 15-25 degrees C, with stronger chorusing observed around 18 degrees C. Abrupt temperature changes caused disruption in choruses and likely in associated spawning. This study highlights the importance of temperature to fish reproduction and demonstrates that PAM can be a useful tool for long-term conservation management plans.

Ten-thousand particles were released at observed and putative spawning locations and were allowed to disperse for the full 71-day pelagic larval duration for A. vulpes.

The prevailing Northern dispersal paradigm exhibited strong connectivity with Grand Bahama, the Berry Islands, Andros, and self-recruitment to lower and upper Abaco. Ephemeral gyres and flow direction within Northwest and Northeast Providence Channels were shown to have important roles in larval retention to the Bahamian Archipelago. Larval development environments for larvae settling upon different islands showed few differences and dispersal was closely associated with the thermocline. Settlement patterns informed the suggestion for expansion of conservation parks in Grand Bahama, Abaco, and Andros, and the creation of a parks in Eleuthera and the Berry Islands to protect fisheries.

Increased calling (number of files containing E. morio sound) was correlated to sunrise and sunset, and peaked in late summer (July and August) and early winter (November and December). Due to the ubiquitous production of sound, large-scale spatial mapping across the WFS of E. morio sound production was feasible using recordings from shorter duration-fixed location recorders and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).

Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus commerson and bull sharks had the largest unique total areas of isotopic niche space (expressed as a percentage) that did not overlap with any other species, 95% and 69.4 %, respectively, which means they had lower isotopic overlap. In general, faster turnover tissues such as whole blood and plasma showed higher isotopic overlap and smaller niche breadth for all reef predators.

Healthy reef soundscapes are rich with sounds, enabling passive acoustic recording and soundscape analyses to emerge as cost-effective, long-term methods for monitoring reef communities. Yet most biological reef sounds have not been identified or described, limiting the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring for diversity assessments. Machine learning offers a solution to scale such analyses but has yet to be successfully applied to characterize the diversity of reef fish sounds. Here we sought to characterize and categorize coral reef fish sounds using unsupervised machine learning methods. Pulsed fish and invertebrate sounds from 480 min of data sampled across 10 days over a 2-month period on a US Virgin Islands reef were manually identified and extracted, then grouped into acoustically similar clusters using unsupervised clustering based on acoustic features. The defining characteristics of these clusters were described and compared to determine the extent of acoustic diversity detected on these reefs. Approximately 55 distinct calls were identified, ranging in centroid frequency from 50 Hz to 1,300 Hz. Within this range, two main sub-bands containing multiple signal types were identified from 100 Hz to 400 Hz and 300 Hz-700 Hz, with a variety of signals outside these two main bands. These methods may be used to seek out acoustic diversity across additional marine habitats. The signals described here, though taken from a limited dataset, speak to the diversity of sounds produced on coral reefs and suggest that there might be more acoustic niche differentiation within soniferous fish communities than has been previously recognized.",2024-08-15,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

A STATE OF ART ON THE LATEST ADVANCES,"As it is unlikely that successful settlement is solely a matter of chance (i.e. to find a suitable habitat), one of the greatest challenges facing the fish larvae is how to locate the relatively rare patches of coral reef habitat on which they settle and ultimately reside as adults. The answer must lie partly in the sensory modalities of fishes at settlement. Habitat selection is only possible if fish larvae could detect some environmental cues to select a suitable reef habitat at settlement. The present review aims at providing the latest works dealing with information perception in coral reef fish larvae at settlement. Two decades ago, it was generally assumed that larval behaviors and sensory abilities at settlement were considered too feeble to significantly affect dispersal outcomes. Several recent studies showed that recognition of suitable reef habitats by fish larvae at settlement is based on a combination of visual, chemical and acoustic cues. The first part of our review shows the main advances in the knowledge of visual, chemical and acoustic cues used by fish larvae to detect an island, a reef, a micro-habitat, a conspecific or some predators. The second part of our review deals with the effect of imprinting and/or innate capabilities. The third part focuses on the different cues used at different scales and underlines some contradictory results about the distance of transmission and detection of chemical and acoustic cues in coral reefs. Finally, as global and regional environmental changes have stressed coral reefs to such an extent that they are either destroyed or in decline, the fourth part presents the effects of both anthropogenic and environmental stressors on information perception and response capacities in coral reef fish larvae. If polluted seawater disrupts the larval abilities to find a suitable reef habitat, fish larvae may spend more time in the planktonic environment, resulting in increased energetic costs and predation risk, and consequently a lower larval settlement. We hypothesise that as the stability of fish communities is dependent, in part, on the stability of social interactions, the disruption of ""larvae-habitat relationships"" can have major consequences for larval settlement into adult population with further repercussions for the ecosystem as a whole. Overall, larval settlement of coral reef fish is an excellent example of the complexity of interactions between an organism and its environment as without perceiving environmental cues, fish larva would have very little chance of selecting a suitable reef habitat. Moreover, understanding the relationship between reef state and settlement potential will allow management planning for the maintenance of coral reefs that are increasingly degraded.",2015-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Review article,__EXR__Review article",

We conducted a series of laboratory and field experiments using coral reef fish larvae (Chromis viridis) to determine: ecological determinants of settlement choice (conspecifics vs. heterospecifics vs. coral substrates); sensory mechanisms (visual, acoustic/vibratory, olfactory) underlying settlement choice; and sensory abilities (effective detection distances of habitat) under field conditions. C. viridis larvae responded positively to visual, acoustic/vibratory, and olfactory cues expressed by conspecifics. Overall, larvae chose compartments of experimental arenas containing conspecifics in 75% of trials, and failed to show any significant directional responses to heterospecifics or coral substrates. In field trials, C. viridis larvae detected reefs containing conspecifics using visual and/or acoustic/vibratory cues at distances < 75 cm; detection distances increased to < 375 cm when olfactory capacity was present (particularly for reefs located up-current). We conducted high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of seawater containing C. viridis juveniles and isolated high concentrations of several organic compounds. Subsequent laboratory trials demonstrated that C. viridis larvae responded positively to only one of these organic compounds. This compound was characterized by a weak polarity and was detected at 230 nm with a 31-min retention time in HPLC.

Histological and cleared and stained material revealed that the medial opening in the lateral line canal in the supracleithrum (which defines the laterophysic connection), an inflated physoclistous swim bladder, and the three otolithic organs are already present in the smallest individuals examined (7-15 mm SL).

The three sensory maculae of the ear increase in size, and the shape of the sacculus changes most dramatically with fish growth; hair cell density is highest in the utriculus. Physiological analysis of the reponse to sound pressure showed that larval and juvenile C. ocellatus had a hearing sensitivity peak at 100-200 Hz, which was similar to 30-40 dB more sensitive than that measured in larval coral reef fishes (e.g., damselfishes) that lack swim bladder horns. C. ocellatus did not show any ontogenetic changes in sensitivity to sound pressure, which may be explained by the fact that the growth of the swim bladder horns maintains the small distance between the swim bladder and ear that was established earlier during the larval stage.

One way to assess the ecological functions of such structures is to test whether they function similarly to natural habitats. In marine systems, naturally occurring structured habitats, such as coral reefs and rocky reefs, support aggregations of planktivorous fish, often inducing spatial patterns in prey and predators. Whether similar spatial patterns occur around submerged artificial structures, which often have more abrupt topographies than natural habitats, remains less well understood. We tested whether consistent spatial patterns in planktivorous fish, their prey (zooplankton), and their predators (piscivorous fish) were present around artificial structures. We first documented spatial distributions of these 3 trophic groups around 15 marine artificial structures (shipwrecks) using acoustic surveys and then asked how spatial distributions of each trophic group relate to the others. We found that the center of planktivorous fish aggregations occurred an average of 39 m from habitat edges. Zooplankton prey were detected throughout nearly 25% of surveyed areas around habitats. Piscivorous fish predators concentrated closest to habitats. Further analyses revealed that these patterns sometimes related to environmental factors, such as water current magnitude and direction.

We used chevron traps paired with underwater videos (N = 1555) in a binomial (presence-absence) generalized additive modeling framework to quantify how environmental conditions, habitat characteristics, and the number of individuals at each site (i.e. site abundance) influenced the detection probabilities of economically important reef fish species in the southeastern USA. After accounting for variable site abundance, trap detection probabilities declined 40% for red porgy Pagrus pagrus, 65% for gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus, and 75% for vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens as percent hard bottom increased from 0 to 100%. Increasing water temperature caused red porgy trap detection probability to decline modestly, while for gray triggerfish and vermilion snapper it increased substantially. Underwater video was more likely to detect black sea bass Centropristis striata, red porgy, and gray triggerfish when site abundance and water clarity were high and the video camera was facing downcurrent. Using multiple gears simultaneously, we quantified the ways in which predictor variables influenced the sampling process, which will help in designing surveys that maximize detection probability.

Using a field-calibrated sound propagation model, we predicted the transmission loss in the relevant frequency band as a function of range, depth, and azimuth to estimate the spatial heterogeneity in the acoustic cuescape. The model highlighted the frequency- and depth-dependence of the sound fields fishes may encounter, and we predict these complex spatial patterns influence how sounds function as settlement cues. Both modeling and field measurements supported a non-monotonic decline in amplitude with distance from the reef. We modeled acoustic fields created by sounds at frequencies from 2 common soniferous reef-based animals (snapping shrimps and toadfish) and estimated detection spaces of these sounds for larvae of 2 reef fish species. Results demonstrated that larval depth will influence cue availability and amplitude, and these spatial patterns of detection depend on cue frequency and the larval receiver's auditory sensitivity. Estimated spatial scales of detection coupled with field measurements suggest cue amplitudes might allow some larvae to detect reef-based sounds at a range exposing them to the predicted spatial variation in the acoustic cuescape. In an individual-based model, cues available to even the shortest modeled distances improved settlement success. Our results emphasize the need to consider the frequency- and depth-dependence of the acoustic cues larval fishes encounter to increase understanding of the role of soundscapes in larval settlement.

Sound recently emerged as a leading candidate cue for reef fish larvae navigating from open waters back to the reef. Clearly, the integrity of the auditory organ has a direct bearing on what and how fish larvae hear. Yet, the link between otolith symmetry and effective navigation has never been investigated in fishes. We tested whether otolith asymmetry influenced the ability of returning larvae to detect and successfully recruit to favourable reef habitats. Our results suggest that larvae with asymmetrical otoliths not only encountered greater difficulties in detecting suitable settlement habitats, but may also suffer significantly higher rates of mortality. Further, we found that otolith asymmetries arising early in the embryonic stage were not corrected by any compensational growth mechanism during the larval stage.

However, the intensity of the acoustic cue required to initiate the settlement and metamorphosis response, and therefore the potential range over which this acoustic cue may operate, is not known. The current study determined the behavioural response thresholds of four species of New Zealand brachyuran crab megalopae by exposing them to different intensity levels of broadcast reef sound recorded from their preferred settlement habitat and from an unfavourable settlement habitat. Megalopae of the rocky-reef crab, Leptograpsus variegatus, exhibited the lowest behavioural response threshold (highest sensitivity), with a significant reduction in time to metamorphosis (TTM) when exposed to underwater reef sound with an intensity of 90 dB re 1 mu Pa and greater (100, 126 and 135 dB re 1 mu Pa). Megalopae of the mud crab, Austrohelice crassa, which settle in soft sediment habitats, exhibited no response to any of the underwater reef sound levels. All reef associated species exposed to sound levels from an unfavourable settlement habitat showed no significant change in TTM, even at intensities that were similar to their preferred reef sound for which reductions in TTM were observed. These results indicated that megalopae were able to discern and respond selectively to habitat-specific acoustic cues. The settlement and metamorphosis behavioural response thresholds to levels of underwater reef sound determined in the current study of four species of crabs, enables preliminary estimation of the spatial range at which an acoustic settlement cue may be operating, from 5 m to 40 km depending on the species.

We explored reef noise across a gradient of reef qualities, tested sound propagation models against field recordings and combined them with fish audiograms to demonstrate the importance of reef quality in determining which reefs larvae are likely to detect. We found that higher-quality reefs were significantly louder and richer in acoustic events (transient content) than degraded reefs, and observed that sound propagated farther with less attenuation than predicted by classic models.

During the summers of 2000, 2001 and 2004, two small calanoid species, Temora turbinata Dana, 1849 and Paracalanus parvus Claus, 1863 were exposed to a visual predatory fish, the blenny Acanthemblemaria spinosa Metzelaar, 1919, and their predator-prey interactions were recorded using both high-speed and standard videographic techniques. Copepod escape reaction components, including swimming pattern, reactive distance, turning rate, and jump kinetics, were quantified from individual predation events using motion analysis techniques. Among the observed escape reaction components, differences were noted between the species' swimming patterns prior to attack and their response latencies. Temora turbinata was a continuous cruiser and P. parvus exhibited a hop-and-sink swimming pattern. During periods of sinking, P. parvus stopped beating its appendages, which presumably reduced any self-generated hydrodynamic signals and increased perceptual abilities to detect an approaching predator. Response latency was determined for each copepod species using a hydrodynamic stimulus produced by a 1 ms acoustic signal. Response latencies of T. turbinata were significantly longer than those of P. parvus. Despite some apparent perceptual advantages of P. parvus, the blenny successfully captured both species by modifying its attack behavior for the targeted prey.",2007-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

Several theoretical models have used hearing thresholds to estimate the distance at which fish larvae can detect reefs. However, researchers have often measured hearing thresholds from fish raised in aquaculture environments, or held them in closed-system tanks once caught, where equipment can significantly increase the noise levels in the tanks. The possibility arises that exposure to such noise negatively affects the hearing ability of the fish held there, such that distances predicted from these studies may be underestimated. The objective of this study was to compare the hearing ability of wild versus aquacultured snapper Pagrus auratus using auditory evoked potentials. Juvenile snapper from aquaculture tanks had significantly higher hearing thresholds at 100, 200 and 400 Hz than wild snapper. A controlled noise-exposure experiment, where snapper were ex posed for 2 wk to low-intensity noise at 120 dB re 1 mu Pa, confirmed these results. When plotted using an extended reef-based model, the distance at which aquaculture-raised snapper are predicted to detect a particular reef was half of that found for their wild counterparts.

Beyond this zone, the sound level decreases with cylindrical spreading plus any seafloor attenuation.

Members of the genus Chaetodon have a unique peripheral arrangement of the anterior swim bladder that connects with the lateral line ( the laterophysic connection) and in many species projects towards the inner ear. This morphology has lead to the proposal that the laterophysic connection and swim bladder system may be a specialized structure for the detection of sound. However, the relevant stimuli, receiver mechanisms and functions for these putative hearing structures were unknown because butterflyfishes were previously not recognized to produce sounds during natural behavior. We performed field experiments to test the hypothesis that Chaetodon produces sounds in natural social contexts. Acoustic and motor behaviors of the monogamous multiband butterflyfish, C. multicinctus, were evoked and recorded by placement of bottled fish into feeding territories of conspecific pairs. We demonstrate that territory defense includes the production of agonistic sounds and hydrodynamic stimuli that are associated with tail slap, jump, pelvic fin flick and dorsal-anal fin erection behaviors. In addition, grunt pulse trains were produced by bottled intruders and are tentatively interpreted to function as an alert call among pair mates. Acoustic behaviors include low frequency hydrodynamic pulses < 100 Hz, sounds with peak energy from 100 Hz to 500 Hz, and a broadband high frequency click (peak frequency= 3.6 kHz), which is produced only during the tail slap behavior.

Here, we first point out that signaling prey species are often found in mixed-species moving groups or stationary aggregations, and ask the question of how simultaneous signaling, by members of one species or more, might affect predator eavesdropping behavior and the composition of the groups themselves. The detection risk of prey species will be affected by the other species they associate with, and prey should generally avoid joining a group with more detectable species. Yet prey may select to join other species that are preferred by predators, diluting their own risk of attack, as long as that does not lead to substantially greater detection and thereby increased predation. We next review the evidence that prey grouping and collective responses when attacked can confuse predators, leading to lower capture rates. Evidence for this confusion effect mostly involves visually orienting predators. We then ask if a similar phenomenon could occur when animals in a group simultaneously produce acoustic signals and find relevant evidence for predator confusion under such situations in the literature associated with the ""cocktail party effect."" As confusion is heightened by similarities among mixed-species group members, this provides a force at ecological or evolutionary timescales to make species that associate in groups, and their signals, more similar to each other. However, heterogeneous mixed-species groups may be favored if species are differentially preferred as prey. We suggest experiments to examine whether the success rates of acoustically orienting predators depend on the group size of their mixed-species prey.

Here the temporal and spatial characteristics of the underwater sound around an operating FAD were characterised to evaluate sound as a potential cue for fish attraction. The FAD was located in the coastal waters of northeast Malaysia where they are locally known as 'unjam'. The underwater signal of the FAD showed a distinct rise in sound energy between 500 and 2000 Hz across three octave bands. The spectral characteristics of this signal suggest that the source was animals inhabiting the FAD. The daily sound pattern showed that the signal was loudest during dusk, followed by night, dawn and significantly lowest during the day (14-20 dB lower than dusk). There was also a significant relationship between signal loss and distance away from the FAD, however, this did not follow conventional point source spreading models for underwater sound.

We proposed that dynamic vessel sounds (e.g., gear shifting, sudden changes in speed) at known FSA sites and during aggregating periods could be indicative of fishing activity. A band-limited energy detector was used to detect vessel sounds, with detections grouped into discreate vessel events and classified as having only constant vessel sounds or containing dynamic vessel sounds.

We compared the acceleration at points on the sagitta, asteriscus and lapillus when the bladder was air filled with results from models using a water-filled bladder. For larvae of 8.5 - 18 mm in standard length, the air-filled bladder amplified simulated otolith motion by a factor of 54-3485 times that of a water-filled bladder at 100 Hz. Otolith-bladder distance increased with standard length, which decreased modeled amplification. The concomitant rapid increase in bladder volume partially compensated for the effect of increasing otolith-bladder distance. Calculated resonant frequency of the bladders was between 8750 and 4250 Hz, and resonant frequency decreased with increasing bladdervolume. There was a relatively flat frequency dependence of these effects in the audible frequency range, but we found a small increase in amplification with increasing excitation frequency. Using idealized geometry, we found that the larval vertebrae and ribs have negligible influence on bladder motion. Our results help clarify the auditory consequences of ontogenetic changes in bladder morphology and otolith-bladder relationships during larval stages.",2019-08-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

The purpose of the present study was to examine existing hearing data of fishes in relation to ambient sound levels around reefs to estimate the distance over which reef fish might detect reefs sounds, and to highlight how future data should be collected to answer this important question. The few available measurements of larval fish hearing indicate that they have poor acoustic sensitivity relative to sound levels found around reefs. The apparent poor sensitivity of larval fishes to sound pressure suggests that particle motion, the back and forth motion of water that is associated with acoustic pressure, is the principal stimulus for larval fish hearing. To estimate the maximum distance of orientation to reefs, the acoustic particle velocity of reef sound was calculated from measurements of the acoustic pressure on and away from shore, assuming conditions of a planar propagating wave. Based on these calculations, we propose that larval fishes in acoustically unbounded habitats most probably cannot detect the ambient noise of particle motion at distances >1 km. To better understand the distances over which larval fishes can detect sounds from reefs, more studies on larval fish hearing and reef noise are needed. Larval fish hearing measurements need to independently distinguish sensitivities to particle motion and acoustic pressure. Likewise, independent measurements of particle motion around reefs are required.",2007-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

Therefore, the current study examined whether acoustic and substrate cues have the potential to shorten the time to moulting and affect their subsequent nutritional condition in the pueruli of the southern spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii. Individuals moulted to first instar juveniles up to 38 % faster when exposed to the underwater sound from two types of typical settlement habitat (coastal kelp- and urchin-dominated reefs) compared to those with no underwater sound. The settlement delay in the post-larvae without underwater sound also resulted in juveniles in poorer survival and nutritional condition as measured by their protein and lipid contents. In a separate experiment, post-larvae presented with seaweed and rock substrates were found to complete settlement and moult to juvenile by as much as 20 % faster compared to those on the sand and control treatments.

Ecological studies have shown that different benthic communities (i.e. communities composed of different biological taxa) exist along several spatial gradients on all reefs. Since these studies are limited by time and spatial extent, acoustic surveys with the QTCView V bottom classification system based on a 50 kHz transducer were used as an alternative method of producing habitat maps. From the acoustic data of a 3.1 km(2) survey area, spatial prediction maps were created for the area. These were compared with habitat maps interpreted from in situ data and Laser Airborne Depth Sounder (LADS) bathymetry, in order to ground-truth the remotely sensed data. An error matrix was used to quantitatively determine the accuracy of the acoustically derived spatial prediction model against the maps derived from the in situ and LADS data sets. Confusion analysis of 100 random points showed that the system was able to distinguish areas of reef from areas of rubble and sand with an overall accuracy of 61%. When asked to detect more subtle spatial differences, for example, those between distinct reef communities, the classification was only about 40% accurate.

The EAR is a microprocessor-based autonomous recorder that periodically samples the ambient sound field and also automatically detects sounds that meet specific criteria.

Snapping shrimp produced the dominant acoustic energy on the reefs examined and exhibited clear diel acoustic trends. Other biological sounds recorded included those produced by fish and cetaceans, which also exhibited distinct temporal variability.

Remote sensing tools offer solutions to this problem. We tested the ability of the acoustic seafloor classification system, Quester Tangent Corporation (QTC) Impact, to detect the presence of green-lipped mussel (Perna canaliculus) populations on sub-tidal rocky reefs. Acoustic data were collected from a range of visual subtidal habitats, combined, and analysed using QTC Impact's principal component analysis and clustering software. Discriminant function analysis assessed whether visually distinctive habitats could be correctly classified using this acoustic data only.

Here, we sought to address several basic biophysical drivers of reef sound by investigating acoustic activity patterns of snapping shrimp populations on two adjacent coral reefs using a detailed snap detection analysis routine to a high-resolution 2.5-month acoustic dataset from the US Virgin Islands. The reefs exhibited strong diel and lunar periodicity in snap rates and clear spatial differences in snapping levels. Snap rates peaked at dawn and dusk and were higher overall during daytime versus nighttime, a seldom-reported pattern in earlier descriptions of diel snapping shrimp acoustic activity. Small differences between the sites in snap rate rhythms were detected and illustrate how analyses of specific soundscape elements might reveal subtle between-reef variation. Snap rates were highly correlated with environmental variables, including water temperature and light, and were found to be sensitive to changes in oceanographic forcing. This study further establishes snapping shrimp as key players in the coral reef chorus and provides evidence that their acoustic output reflects a combination of environmental conditions, celestial influences, and spatial habitat variation.

While Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) has recently emerged as a promising tool for monitoring ecological states in marine environments, the specifics of how to apply this method remains poorly defined. In this study we examined how different combinations of sampling settings (frequency bandwidth, time of sampling (day/night), and sample duration) influenced the ability of two acoustic indices, the Sound Pressure Level (SPL) and the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), to discriminate different ecological states (ecostates) of coral reefs. We applied an iterative approach to select the most efficient and consistent combinations of sampling settings to use for these two acoustic indices, depending on the stability of their discriminating power across different time scales (successive days, moon phases, and seasons), and the minimum sampling effort required for reliable ecostate assessment. The ability of SPL and ACI to discriminate ecostate-specific soundscapes was more stable and required less sampling effort at nighttime. For indices calculated in the higher frequency band (> 2 kHz), very short recording times (<= 20 min divided into 5 s samples) were sufficient to discriminate ecostates, whereas longer recording times (>= 200 min divided into 5 min samples) were necessary when using indices calculated in the lower frequency bands (< 1 kHz). An optimised sampling scheme, i.e. the group of the five best combinations of settings to discern among coral reef ecostates, was determined at Reunion Island, Indian Ocean, then tested at New Caledonia, Pacific Ocean. Here, the classifications obtained through visual surveys and with the optimised acoustic sampling scheme were congruent. The concordance of our results with visual fish counts confirms the potential of ecoacoustics to rapidly and reliably characterise coral reefs' ecostate, allowing managers to prioritise conservation areas among numerous sites, and detect ecological changes over time.

Benthic invertebrates were the major contributors to the ambient noise, producing acoustic mass phenomena (3.5-5.5 kHz) that could propagate at more than 90 km under flat/calm sea conditions and more than 50 km with an average wind regime of 6 knots.

Few examinations of aquatic soundscapes have reported particle motion levels and variability, despite their relevance to invertebrates and fishes. In this study, ambient particle acceleration was quantified from orthogonal hydrophone arrays over several months at four coral reef sites, which varied in benthic habitat and fish communities. Time-averaged particle acceleration magnitudes were similar across axes, within 3 dB. Temporal trends of particle acceleration corresponded with those of sound pressure, and the strength of diel trends in both metrics significantly correlated with percent coral cover. Higher magnitude particle accelerations diverged further from pressure values, potentially representing sounds recorded in the near field. Particle acceleration levels were also reported for boat and example fish sounds. Comparisons with particle acceleration derived audiograms suggest the greatest capacity of invertebrates and fishes to detect soundscape components below 100 Hz, and poorer detectability of soundscapes by invertebrates compared to fishes. Based on these results, research foci are discussed for which reporting of particle motion is essential, versus those for which sound pressure may suffice.

These methods work best in uncluttered environments. Coral reef environments can be expected to be encountered relatively frequently In very shallow water mine countermeasures operations. A coral reef is a prime example of an environment where acoustical methods can be expected to have difficulty due to the high density of clutter. A prototype Fluorescence Imaging Laser Line Scan (FILLS) sensor has demonstrated that fluorescence imagery provides strong signatures that may be used to separate the coral clutter from mines. FILLS imagery demonstrates the case with which a human observer can differentiate mine like objects (MLOs) from natural clutter in an environment that is difficult for sonars. Accordingly, this technology is a leading candidate for extending MCM capabilities into highly cluttered environments. In this role, FILLS imagery can be used for MLC detection, classification, and identification.        Our prototype FILLS sensor utilizes a scanning blue laser and 4 independent, synchronously scanning receiver channels. One channel produces Imagery from the elastically scattered (blue) reflected laser light. The other three channels produce imagery from collected green, yellow, and red light. In coral reef environments, florescence processes produce this green, yellow, and red light. This fluorescence is concentrated in the corals, but may also occur in the surrounding sediment.        In the clear water characteristic of coral reef environments, human observers may differentiate manmade objects from the coral clutter through shape analysis. While this process is ""easy"" for a trained human observer on an Image-by-image basis, it is time consuming and tiring. It is highly desirable to develop automatic algorithms that will automatically highlight the manmade objects in the imagery, while rejecting the coral reef clutter in the imagery. The human observer will then be queued to focus his attention on a small set of objects for identification.

However, current measures of restoration success are based largely on coral cover, which does not fully reflect ecosystem function or reef health. Soundscapes are an important aspect of reef health; loud and diverse soundscapes guide the recruitment of reef organisms, but this process is compromised when degradation denudes soundscapes. As such, acoustic recovery is a functionally important component of ecosystem recovery. Here, we use acoustic recordings taken at one of the world's largest coral reef restoration projects to test whether successful restoration of benthic and fish communities is accompanied by a restored soundscape. We analyse recordings taken simultaneously on healthy, degraded (extensive historic blast fishing) and restored reefs (restoration carried out for 1-3 years on previously degraded reefs). We compare soundscapes using manual counts of biotic sounds (phonic richness), and two commonly used computational analyses (acoustic complexity index [ACI] and sound-pressure level [SPL]). Healthy and restored reef soundscapes exhibited a similar diversity of biotic sounds (phonic richness), which was significantly higher than degraded reef soundscapes. This pattern was replicated in some automated analyses but not others; the ACI exhibited the same qualitative result as phonic richness in a low-frequency, but not a high-frequency bandwidth, and there was no significant difference between SPL values in either frequency bandwidth. Furthermore, the low-frequency ACI and phonic richness scores were only weakly correlated despite showing a qualitatively equivalent overall result, suggesting that these metrics are likely to be driven by different aspects of the reef soundscape. Synthesis and applications. These data show that coral restoration can lead to soundscape recovery, demonstrating the return of an important ecosystem function. They also suggest that passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) might provide functionally important measures of ecosystem-level recovery-but only some PAM metrics reflect ecological status, and those that did are likely to be driven by different communities of soniferous animals.

Interstitial spaces created by the structure of rocky reefs form microenvironments where incubating embryos and juvenile fish are potentially protected from predators and physical displacement. However, if interstitial spaces are filled or blocked by sediment or biofouling, the reef structure may lose these benefits. Common practices to restore reef habitat include augmentation of existing reef structures or construction of new reefs, though these practices can be costly. We explored an alternative approach for reef remediation. In 2018, we developed two benthic sled cleaning devices that used either propulsion or pressurized water jets and were towed behind a small vessel to clean reefs. We used the devices to clean two impaired natural rocky reefs in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. We indexed effectiveness of cleaning by measured changes in substrate relative hardness before and after cleaning. A biological response to reef cleaning was also measured by egg deposition of fall (Lake Whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis) and spring (Walleye Sander vitreus) lithophilic spawners. We found that our propulsion cleaning device was more effective in increasing substrate relative hardness than was the water jet device, although this was not consistent among all study locations. We also found that egg deposition on study plots was variable, but in general, egg deposition was highest on study plots that had the greatest increases in relative hardness post-cleaning. The practicality of cleaning devices is likely related to the magnitude of site-specific degradation.

Given the constraints of traditional methods to respond to those needs, the potential of complementary tools such as Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) is emerging. Coral reef soundscapes (i.e. ambient sound) encompass sounds produced by numerous organisms. Soundscape characteristics quantified by ecoacoustic indices have been found to reflect general ecosystem properties, such as diversity and abundance of fishes, and coral cover. The present study tested, on the virtually pristine coral reefs around Europa Island, South-West Indian Ocean, the capacity of acoustic indices to assess key ecosystem functions. Soundscapes were recorded during 2 h, and ecosystem functions were evaluated using video footage of the fish assemblages and underwater photogrammetry of the benthic landscapes. We found significant and strong correlations between six ecoacoustic indices and six key ecosystem functions, including habitat features and fish assemblage characteristics. The six ecoacoustic indices were representative of several combinations of frequency, amplitude and time analysis domains, highlighting the diversity of the functional information conveyed by soundscapes. Our findings reveal that a 2 h daytime recording on a coral reef could provide sufficient acoustic information to characterise major ecosystem functions of a site. This should facilitate the detection of functional disturbances at temporal and spatial scales adapted to the rapidity of upcoming climate changes.

Non-invasive passive acoustic assessments may address this need, leveraging the rich variety and spatiotemporal variability of biological sounds present in coral reef environments and offering near-continuous temporal coverage. Despite this, acoustic metrics that reliably represent coral reef health are still debated, and ground-truthing of methods is limited. Here we investigated how the prevalence of low frequency biotic sounds (without species information) relates to coral reef health, providing a foundation from which one can compare assessment methods. We first quantified call rates of these low frequency sounds for three reefs exhibiting different community assemblages around St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, by manually annotating presumed fish noises for 1 min every 30 min across 8 days for each site. Annotated days were selected at key points across lunar cycles. These call rates were then compared with traditional visual surveys, and several acoustic methods and indices commonly used in underwater soundscape research. We found that, overall, manually detected fish call rates successfully differentiated between the three reefs, capturing variation in crepuscular activity levels-a pattern consistent with previous work that highlights the importance of diel choruses. Moreover, fish vocal rates were predictors of hard coral cover, fish abundance, and fish species richness, while most acoustic indices failed to parse out fine distinctions among the three sites. Some, such as the Acoustic Complexity Index, failed to reveal any expected differences between sites or times of day, while the Bioacoustic Index could only identify the most acoustically active reef, otherwise having weak correlations to visual metrics. Of the indices tested, root-mean-squared sound pressure level and Acoustic Entropy, both calculated in the low frequency fish band (50-1,200 Hz), showed the strongest association with visual health measures. These findings present an important step toward using soundscape cues for reef health assessments.

Bathymetric and intensity data were collected in shallow water (<50 m depth) coral reef ecosystems using two conventional remote sensing technologies: (1) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and (2) ship-based multibeam (MBES) Sound Navigation and Ranging (SoNAR). A comparative assessment using a suite of twelve metrics demonstrated that LiDAR and MBES were equally capable of discriminating seafloor topography (r = >0.9), although LiDAR depths were found to be consistently shallower than MBES depths. The intensity datasets were not significantly correlated at a broad 4 x 5 km spatial scale (r = -0.11), but were moderately correlated in flat areas at a fine 4 x 500 m spatial scale (r = 0.51), indicating that the LiDAR intensity algorithm needs to be improved before LiDAR intensity surfaces can be used for habitat mapping. LiDAR cost 6.6% less than MBES and required 40 fewer hours to map the same study area. MBES provided more detail about the seafloor by fully ensonifying high-relief features, by differentiating between fine and coarse sediments and by collecting data with higher spatial resolutions. Surface fractal dimensions and fast Fourier transformations emerged as useful methods for detecting artifacts in the datasets. Overall, LiDAR provided a more cost effective alternative to MBES for mapping and monitoring shallow water coral reef ecosystems (<50 m depth), although the unique advantages of MBES may make it a more appropriate choice for answering certain ecological or geological questions requiring very high resolution data.

Particle motion (i.e., not pressure) is the relevant acoustic stimulus for many, if not most, marine animals. However, there have been no field measurements of reef particle motion. To address this deficiency, both pressure and particle motion were recorded at a range of distances from one Hawaiian coral reef at dawn and mid-morning on three separate days. Sound pressure attenuated with distance from the reef at dawn. Similar trends were apparent for particle velocity but with considerable variability. In general, average sound levels were low and perhaps too faint to be used as an orientation cue except very close to the reef.

To investigate how sounds produced on a given reef relate to abiotic and biotic parameters and how that relationship may change over time, an observational study was conducted between September 2014 and January 2016 at seven Hawaiian reefs that varied in coral cover, rugosity, and fish assemblages. The reefs were equipped with temperature loggers and acoustic recording devices that recorded on a 10% duty cycle. Benthic and fish visual survey data were collected four times over the course of the study. On average, reefs ranged from 0 to 80% live coral cover, although changes between surveys were noted, in particular during the major El Nio-related bleaching event of October 2015. Acoustic analyses focused on two frequency bands (50-1200 and 1.8-20.5 kHz) that corresponded to the dominant spectral features of the major sound-producing taxa on these reefs, fish, and snapping shrimp, respectively. In the low-frequency band, the presence of humpback whales (December-May) was a major contributor to sound level, whereas in the high-frequency band sound level closely tracked water temperature. On shorter timescales, the magnitude of the diel trend in sound production was greater than that of the lunar trend, but both varied in strength among reefs, which may reflect differences in the species assemblages present. Results indicated that the magnitude of the diel trend was related to fish densities at low frequencies and coral cover at high frequencies; however, the strength of these relationships varied by season.

More recently, multispectral multibeam backscatter has emerged as a promising endeavor in seabed classification, and its acoustic response across multiple frequencies has been studied in a range of substrates. Coral reef systems are an under-represented seabed type within this research, as these shallow water ecosystems are more commonly mapped with optical remote sensing techniques. Further investigation is necessary to determine the extent to which backscatter data can contribute to the characterization of these habitats-especially for reef systems that are beyond the reach of optical remote sensing approaches. This study investigates the multifrequency acoustic response of coral reefs in two study areas on the Abrolhos Shelf, Brazil. Backscatter mosaics and angular response curves (ARC) are investigated to explore the potential applications of these data for enhanced reef seascape characterization. In both survey areas, the acoustic mapping revealed extensive reef features, and the assessment of acoustic response was influenced by reef surface roughness and biological attributes (algal cover). Results contribute significantly to the understanding of multi-frequency signatures in reef seascapes and highlight the potential of backscatter for mapping and monitoring the health of these ecosystems. Herein, the higher frequencies were found to be fundamental for detection of subtle variations in texture in the inter-reef region of both study areas; this underscores the value of employing these frequencies in a multispectral framework for discerning heterogeneities in coarse substrate types. Furthermore, the lower frequencies were indispensable for more precise delineation of reef characteristics in the Abrolhos Channel area, whereas the higher frequencies were the most effective in identifying reefs with epibiotic cover (those characterized by flatter ARC associated with lower backscatter values) in the Forgotten Reefs region.",2024-11-19,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

Multiple acoustic recorders were deployed for intensive 24 h periods and longer-term (similar to 4 mo) duty-cycled deployments on 3 reefs that varied in coral cover and fish density. Short-term results suggest that while there were statistically significant acoustic differences among recorders on a given reef, these differences were relatively small, indicating that a single sensor may be suitable for acoustic characterization of reefs. Analyses of sounds recorded over approximately 4 mo indicated that the strength of diel trends in a low frequency fish band (100 to 1000 Hz) was correlated with coral cover and fish density but the strength of high-frequency snapping shrimp (2 to 20 kHz) trends was not, suggesting that low-frequency recordings may be better indicators of the species assemblages present.

Yet, little is known about how ecoacoustic activity in marine habitats is altered by environmental changes such as temperature. The sounds produced by dense colonies of snapping shrimp dominate temperate and tropical coastal soundscapes worldwide and are a major driver broadband sound pressure level (SPL) patterns. Field recordings of soundscape patterns from the range limit of a snapping shrimp distribution showed that rates of snap production and associated SPL were closely positively correlated to water temperature. Snap rates changed by 15-60% per degrees C change in regional temperature, accompanied by fluctuations in SPL between 1-2 dB per degrees C. To test if this relationship was due to a direct effect of temperature, we measured snap rates in controlled experiments using two snapping shrimp species dominant in the Western Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico (Alpheus heterochaelis and A. angulosus). Snap rates were measured for shrimp held at different temperatures (across 10-30 degrees C range, with upper limit 2 degrees C above current summer mean temperatures) and under different social groupings. Temperature had a significant effect on shrimp snap rates for all social contexts tested (individuals, pairs, and groups). For individuals and shrimp groups, snap production more than doubled between mid-range (20 degrees C) and high (30 degrees C) temperature treatments. Given that snapping shrimp sounds dominate the soundscapes of diverse habitats, including coral reefs, rocky bottoms, seagrass, and oyster beds, the strong influence of temperature on their activity will potentially alter soundscape patterns broadly. Increases in ambient sound levels driven by elevated water temperatures has ecological implications for signal detection, communication, and navigation in key coastal ecosystems for a wide range of organisms, including humans.",2022-08-18,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

Acoustic positioning was generally inaccurate and bottom tracking unreliable on rough terrain. Subtransect lengths assessed with PhotoModeler were on average 20 % longer than those derived from acoustic positioning due to the higher spatial resolution and the inclusion of slope.

Optic and acoustic remote sensing are becoming common survey tools in seafloor habitat mapping. However, a single acoustic or optic technique may have a limited detection range and be more susceptible to the impact of image quality. Additionally, it is challenging to satisfy the requirements for accurate detection since single-source data cannot fully reflect the substrate distribution characteristics. This article developed a method for detecting coastal seafloor habitats through the fusion of multiscale optics and acoustics data. First, the original feature set was composed of multispectral satellite data and bathymetric data by multibeam echo sounder and airborne light detection and ranging at different scales, which improved the capacity to represent feature information. Then, a ReliefF-mRMR method was implemented to select optimal features with appropriate scales and remove redundant features. Finally, the optimal features were employed in model training and classification of several supervised classifiers to verify the effectiveness of the strategy. The developed method was applied to the Ganquan Island survey in the South China Sea. The results demonstrated that, after integrating multisource data, the accuracies were up to 3.31% and 17.28% higher than those obtained using multispectral data or bathymetric data alone, respectively. ReliefF-mRMR exhibited better performance than other feature selection methods. The average coral coverage in the study area was estimated to range from 70.85% to 80.33%.

Water velocity measurements obtained in a range of wave conditions confirm the presence of a wave -induced bias (Vb,,) that is closely related to the Stokes drift. Moreover, AUV-based water velocity measurements are also subject to a wave -induced alias that results from a Doppler shifting of the measured wave velocity field. Wave induced aliasing can enhance or suppress the bias by an amount that is proportional to the ratio of the vehicle velocity relative to the wave velocity.

A key knowledge gap in the successful implementation of grey reef shark conservation plans is the understanding of large-scale movement patterns, along with the associated biological and ecological drivers. To address this shortfall, we acoustically monitored 147 adult and juvenile grey reef sharks of all sexes for more than 2 yr across the New Caledonian archipelago, West Pacific. Here, we document multiple adult males undertaking return journeys of up to nearly 700 km in consecutive years. This constitutes the first evidence of repeated long-range migrations for this species. Although only a limited number of adult males were definitively tracked undertaking migrations, similar timing in changes in the detection patterns of a further 13 animals, mostly adult males, suggests this behavior may be more common than previously thought. The paucity of evidence for juvenile migrations and timing of adult movements suggest that mating is the motivation behind these migrations.

These slopes can be coral reefs or the heads of young, presumably unconsolidated, basalt flows. Under this geometry, modeling based on raytracing indicates that the seismic record of the T phase consists of a P wave at distances from the conversion point greater than 9 km; at shorter distances, S waves and surface waves are generated. In the absence of a steep slope, only surface waves are present.

Underwater exploratory vehicles typically employ wide-aperture Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) imaging sensors. Although their wide aperture enables scouring large volumes of water ahead of them for obstacles, the resulting images produced are blurry due to integration over the aperture. Performing three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from this blurry data is notoriously difficult. This challenging inverse problem is further exacerbated by the presence of speckle noise and reverberations. The state-of-the-art methods in 3D reconstruction from sonar either require bulky and expensive matrix-arrays of sonar sensors or additional narrow-aperture sensors. Due to its low footprint, the latter induces gaps between reconstructed scans. Avoiding such gaps requires slow and cumbersome scanning by the vehicles that carry the scanners. In this paper, we present two reconstruction methods enabling on-site 3D reconstruction from imaging sonars of any aperture. The first of these presents an elegant linear formulation of the problem, as a blind deconvolution with a spatially varying kernel. The second method is a simple algorithmic approach for approximate reconstruction, using a nonlinear formulation. We demonstrate that our simple approximation algorithms perform 3D reconstruction directly from the data recorded by wide-aperture systems, thus eliminating the need for multiple sensors to be mounted on underwater vehicles for this purpose. Additionally, we observe that the wide aperture may be exploited to improve the coverage of the reconstructed samples (on the scanned object's surface). We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on simulated as well as real data acquired using two sensors, and we compare our work to the state of the art in sonar reconstruction. Finally, we show the employability of our reconstruction methods on field data gathered by an autonomous underwater vehicle.",2018-09-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

Tracking species diversity is vital to managing these stressed habitats. Yet, quantifying and monitoring biodiversity is often challenging, especially in ocean habitats. Given that many animals make sounds, these cues travel efficiently under water, and emerging technologies are increasingly cost-effective, passive acoustics (a long-standing ocean observation method) is now a potential means of quantifying and monitoring marine biodiversity. Properly applying acoustics for biodiversity assessments is vital. Our goal here is to provide a timely consideration of emerging methods using passive acoustics to measure marine biodiversity. We provide a summary of the brief history of using passive acoustics to assess marine biodiversity and community structure, a critical assessment of the challenges faced, and outline recommended practices and considerations for acoustic biodiversity measurements. We focused on temperate and tropical seas, where much of the acoustic biodiversity work has been conducted. Overall, we suggest a cautious approach to applying current acoustic indices to assess marine biodiversity.

The acoustic system uses echo return amplitude to compute acoustic impedance that is then correlated with sampled sediment impedance values calculated from wet bulk density and compressional wave velocity. Several bottom provinces were identified using the 15-kHz data to construct a real-time map of ship tracks in colors that represent the surficial sediment facies type. Sediment facies over the entire study site (36 km 2) range from sandy silts to exposed limestone rock and coral reef structures. Color contour maps using the 12-kHz data, created after correlating acoustic impedance predictions with core measured sediment properties, validates the initial facies pattern predictions made in real-time. The sediment facies patterns indicate a long-term pattern of deposition of fine-grained, silt-sized, surficial sediments in an area adjacent to the emergent carbonate embankment. Two-dimensional acoustic profiles along survey tracklines also provide cross-sectional views of seafloor and subbottom stratigraphy that confirm the buildup of these fine sediments in the northwest corner of the study site. A generous supply of sediment resulting from an abundance of benthic green algae (Halimeda sp.) on adjacent shallow platforms form a thick sequence of fine sandy silt at the base of the southeastern edge of the embankment and fringing reef.

The goals and scope of the individual research projects vary but all use the same receiver array throughout Lake Sharpe in central South Dakota. Prior to initiating the telemetry studies, we sought to describe the detection probability of receivers from a representation of habitats within Lake Sharpe, South Dakota. We used both a V9-2H transmitter and a V13-1L transmitter in combination with VR2W 69 kHz passive receivers [all from Innovasea (Vemco)] to determine detection probability in four novel habitats of Lake Sharpe. Both transmitter and receiver were moored at fixed distances (200 m 400, and 600 m) for multiple consecutive days and detection probability compared between transmitter type, distance, site, and diel period using ANOVA following arcsine square-root transformation. Results We found significant differences in detection probability between the four habitat types for both the V9 and V13 transmitters. Sites protected from wind and wave action, and with little boat traffic, had larger detection ranges compared to areas that were wind exposed and host more boat traffic. The site immediately downstream from a hydroelectric dam that is exposed to both high wind fetch and is popular for boating, exhibited the poorest detection probability at all distances for both transmitter types. V13 transmitters consistently exhibited greater detection probability relative to V9 transmitters and this difference was greater at further distances. In general, detection probability was higher at nighttime compared to daytime and these differences were significant dependent on transmitter, site, and distance. Conclusions Using the information presented, SDGFP has modified their receiver array to maximize the ability to detect acoustic transmitters in the novel habitats of Lake Sharpe. Specifically, receiver spacing was reduced and/or expanded dependent on the distance, where 50% detection probability was attained.

In the present study, we propose a new methodological approach to characterize the seabed at Serrana Bank (14.27 degrees-14.48 degrees N and 80.10 degrees-80.23 degrees W), located in the Colombian Basin of the Caribbean Sea, by combining acoustic information (split-beam echosounder) and underwater imagery.

However, effective monitoring of this stressor is currently limited by a lack of tools. The present study coupled passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) with timelapse imagery to provide a comprehensive analysis of sound pollution at two coastal sites varying in habitat structure: Goat (rocky reef) and Kawau (sandy bay) Islands. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to automatically count boats in each image, and the relationship between the soundscape and number of boats present was analysed using power spectral density and adaptive threshold analyses. Small boat activity was positively correlated with third octave level (TOL) root mean squared sound pressure levels (SPLRMS 63 - 5011 Hz), and this effect was frequency dependent, at both Goat (F-7,F-9704 = 5.665, p < 0.001) and Kawau (F-7,F-42488 = 325.33, p < 0.001) Islands. However, at Goat Island this interaction effect was driven by a significant difference between 63 Hz and all other TOLs (p < 0.05), whereas at Kawau Island the interaction effect of TOL and boat number was more variable. Furthermore, low frequency (similar to 50 - 300 Hz) biophony was found to influence the likelihood of boat sound being detected at Goat Island. Small boat impacts are contextual, likely due to habitat specific propagation conditions and the presence/absence of vocalising animals. As such, monitoring of sound pollution in coastal habitats requires a tailored approach which accounts for the localised nature of shallow coastal soundscapes.

Several studies have been conducted to understand the activity of snapping shrimp through comparison with surrounding environmental factors. In this paper, we report the analysis of the sound produced by snapping shrimp inhabiting an area where sunlight rarely reaches. The acoustic measurements were taken in May 2015 using two 16-channel vertical line arrays (VLAs) moored at a depth of about 100 m, located similar to 100 km southwest of Jeju Island, South Korea, as part of the Shallow-water Acoustic Variability Experiment (SAVEX-15). During the experiment, the underwater soundscape was dominated by the broadband impulsive snapping shrimp noise, which is notable considering that snapping shrimp are commonly observed at very shallow depths of tens of meters or less where sunlight can easily reach. To extract snapping events in the ambient noise data, an envelope correlation combined with an amplitude threshold detection algorithm were applied, and then the sea surface-bounced path was filtered out using a kurtosis value of the waveform to avoid double-counting in snap rate estimates. The analysis of the ambient noise data received for 5 consecutive days indicated that the snap rate fluctuated with a strong one-quarter-diurnal variation between 200 and 1,200 snaps per minute, which is distinguished from the periodicity of the snap rate reported in the euphotic zone. The temporal variation in the snap rate is compared with several environmental factors such as water temperature, tidal level, and current speed.

Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are thought to aggregate in nearshore tropical waters due to seasonally enhanced foraging opportunities. This implies that the three-dimensional movements of these animals may be associated with bio-physical properties that enhance prey availability. To date, few studies have tested this hypothesis.        Methods Here, we conducted ship-based acoustic surveys, net tows and water column profiling (salinity, temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence) to determine the volumetric density, distribution and community composition of mesozooplankton (predominantly euphausiids and copepods) and oceanographic properties of the water column in the vicinity of whale sharks that were tracked simultaneously using satellite-linked tags at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. Generalised linear mixed effect models were used to explore relationships between the 3-dimensional movement behaviours of tracked sharks and surrounding prey fields at a spatial scale of similar to 1 km.        Results We identified prey density as a significant driver of horizontal space use, with sharks occupying areas along the reef edge where densities were highest. These areas were characterised by complex bathymetry such as reef gutters and pinnacles. Temperature and salinity profiles revealed a well-mixed water column above the height of the bathymetry (top 40 m of the water column). Regions of stronger stratification were associated with reef gutters and pinnacles that concentrated prey near the seabed, and entrained productivity at local scales (similar to 1 km). We found no quantitative relationship between the depth use of sharks and vertical distributions of horizontally averaged prey density. Whale sharks repeatedly dove to depths where spatially averaged prey concentration was highest but did not extend the time spent at these depth layers.

Seismic observations are essential for such monitoring, but there were no operational seismic stations in Tonga at the time of the eruption. There are only a few islands near Tongan volcanoes, and installation and maintenance of seismic stations on remote islands are expensive. Seismic observations based on distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) using a seafloor cable may provide a more practical and economical solution. To investigate the potential of this approach, we made preliminary DAS observations for 1 week using the seafloor domestic broadband telecommunications cable in Tonga. DAS equipment was installed at the landing station of the seafloor cable at Nuku'alofa on Tongatapu, the main island of Tonga. To provide reference data, we installed several seismometers on Tongatapu. The DAS data we obtained showed high noise levels in areas of shallow coral reef, but noise levels decreased greatly in deeper water areas, indicating that DAS is suitable for seismic observations of the deep seafloor. We detected many local and regional earthquakes during our week of observation and determined 17 earthquake hypocenters by picking P- and S-wave arrival times from the DAS and onshore seismic data. Although most of these were tectonic events related to the subduction of the Pacific plate along the Tonga trench, several events were detected around the volcanic chain of the Tongan archipelago including one event beneath the HTHH crater, implying that activity at HTHH has continued since the 2022 eruption.

The submerged reefs are mainly topographically characterized by low mound protrusions, several to 20 m above the modern seafloor, and they exhibit three typical acoustic facies in the acoustic profile: punctate reflection, planar reflection, and mound reflection. Based on various geophysical data, we propose at least four stages (I-IV) of submerged reefs on the continental shelf edge and upper slope: The oldest stage I submerged reefs are covered by loose sedimentary strata of > 100 m thickness, a minority of stage II submerged reefs outcrop on the modern seafloor, and most stage III and IV submerged reefs outcrop on the seafloor.

The past decade has witnessed the growing interest in investigating the acoustical activity of snapping shrimp across many shallow waters including the coastal line of the west Pacific Ocean. It was extended to the Southeast China coastal area where snapping sounds and the associated soundscape were recorded at four sites. Customized codes incorporating bandwidth and amplitude threshold operations were developed to detect snaps from the ambient noise to estimate snap rate and extract snaps individually. The subsequent analysis suggested that snaps recorded at different sites were unanimously stronger than background noise. Sound pressure level of the snaps ranged from 150 dB to 190 dB (re 1 mu Pa). The characteristics of snaps, including sound pressure level, duration, peak frequency, -3dB bandwidth from different sites are examined to evaluate the variability across the sites. Though snapping pulses had peak frequencies and the -3 dB bandwidth consistently below 10 kHz, snaps had considerable energy extending to the high frequency range over 200 kHz. The analysis of the acoustic data received for 7 consecutive days at one site indicated that the snap rate corresponded to tidal level periodicity. A high tide was accompanied with a local high snap rate regardless of light but this local snap rate peak was much higher at night. The mean rate fluctuated between 2000 and 4000 snaps per minute and more snaps were recorded after sunset suggesting that snapping shrimp living in the area snapped in response to light.

Examples include ground-truthing aerial and satellite imagery, characterizing essential habitat, assessing changes, and monitoring the progress of restoration efforts. To address some of these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey developed the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based sensor package for mapping shallow-water bcnthic environments. ATRIS consists of a digital still camera, a video camera, and an acoustic depth sounder affixed to a moveable pole. This design, however, restricts its deployment to clear waters less than 10 in deep. To overcome this limitation, a towed version has been developed, referred to as Deep ATRIS. The system is based on a light-weight, computer-control led, towed vehicle that is capable of following a programmed diving profile. The vehicle is 1.3 in long with a 63-cm wing span and can carry a wide variety of research instruments, including CTDs, fluorometers, transmissometers, and cameras. Deep ATRIS is currently equipped with a high-speed (20 frames s(-1)) digital camera, custom-built light-emitting-diode lights, a compass, a 3-axis orientation sensor, and a nadir-looking altimeter. The vehicle dynamically adjusts its altitude to maintain a fixed height above the seafloor. The camera has a 29 degrees x 22 degrees field-of-view and captures color images that are 1360 x 1024 pixels in size. GPS coordinates are recorded for each image. A gigabit ethernet connection enables the images to be displayed and archived in real time on the surface computer. Deep ATRIS has a maximum tow speed of 2.6 in s(-1) and a theoretical operating tow-depth limit of 27 in. With an improved tow cable, the operating depth can be extended to 90 in.

Because of the long propagation delays of the underwater acoustic channel, Media Access Control (MAC) design is challenging. Although many radio access MAC protocols are based on handshake type between the sender and the receiver such as IEEE 802.11, it is not efficient in underwater acoustic network and handshake-free MAC protocols are getting important. In this paper, we propose a TDD USAAN communication system, which uses SC-FDMA modulation. The target applications are 1) underwater civil engineering machine control and view monitoring, 2) marine aquaculture monitoring such as underwater environment data and fishes, 3) human monitoring and position tracking at marine leisure such as diving, 4) controlling a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) wirelessly to exterminate harmful creatures such as acanthaster in coral reef and so on. The proposed system assumes small service area less than 100 m diameter. Then USAAN system can avoid a hand-shake protocol and instead use TDD protocols. There is one base station and several user stations. Both Down Link (DL) communication from the base station to the user stations and Up Link (UL) communication from the user stations to the base station are supported as Time Division Duplex (TDD) method.        To realize a stable TDD operation with assuming User Equipment movement, twice repeating chirp preamble signal is proposed. The prototype system uses 16-24 kHz ultrasonic channel and total of 169 subcarriers are used in 8 kHz bandwidth to deliver 10.35Kbps by QPSK modulation. The TDD operation has been confirmed by field experimentation using the prototype system at a Dam Lake in Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The Lake experiment demonstrated vertical downward DL and upward UL two way TDD communication. The synchronization robustness has been confirmed by the experiment of User Equipment vertical up and down moving. The proposed chirp preamble method realized stable TDD synchronization in water with maximum moving speed of 0.7m/sec.",2017-10-30,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

Surface cruciform drifters as well as dye patches were tracked across the control volume to get independent measurements of Lagrangian currents. While the dye patch speeds were highly correlated with the depth-averaged current speeds calculated from ADCP data on a 1: 1 basis (r(2) = 0.86, n = 24), drifter speeds exceeded both dye and calculated current speeds by 30-100% on average.

Another use of active-acoustics techniques is the potential to qualitatively describe fish school and seafloor characteristics or the distribution of fish density hotspots. Here, we use a geostatistical approach to describe the distribution of acoustic density hotspots within three fishing regions of the Northern Demersal Scalefish Fishery in Western Australia. This revealed a patchy distribution of hotspots within the three regions, covering almost half of the total areas. Energetic, geometric and bathymetric descriptors of acoustically identified fish schools were clustered using robust sparse k-means clustering with a Clest algorithm to determine the ideal number of clusters. Identified clusters were mainly defined by the energetic component of the school. Seabed descriptors considered were depth, roughness, first bottom length, maximum S-v, kurtosis, skewness and bottom rise time. The ideal number of bottom clusters (maximisation rule with D-Index, Hubert Score and Weighted Sum of Squares), following the majority rule, was three. Cluster 1 (mainly driven by depth) was the sole type present in Region 1, Cluster 2 (mainly driven by roughness and maximum Sv) dominated Region 3, while Region 2 was split up almost equally between Cluster 2 and 3. Detection of indicator species for the three seabed clusters revealed that the selected clusters could be related to biological information.

Obtaining measurements of primary production across entire assemblages of algae over ecologically meaningful spatial scales is difficult, and acoustic techniques emerge as a method to consider. Acoustics has the potential to detect oxygen in gaseous form, hence it can measure primary production that is unseen by methods that use dissolved oxygen to estimate productivity. With levels of dissolved oxygen in kelp environments regularly reaching supersaturation, it is possible - even likely - that ecologically significant proportions of production have been neglected by traditional methods. To investigate the potential use of underwater acoustics in monitoring productivity of macroalgal habitats an experiment was run over two weeks during the Austral summer in February 2012 in Canoe Bay, Tasmania. This paper details the results of ray-based acoustic predictive models for two periods during the experiment chosen to compare contrasting diurnal productivity periods, together with inverted acoustic propagation waveguide features from the empirical experiment itself for these periods. Results of the Bellhop modelling suggest that acoustic transmissions can detect ecologically significant proportions of oxygen in gaseous form in seaweed environments (> 5% of total predicted production). However, changes in diurnal cycles of oxygen production were not seen in the empirical acoustic data during the experimental period, indicating that it is unlikely that there was a significant level of oxygen in gaseous form in the canopy layer. This work details the first research into the use of acoustics to measure productivity in macroalgal systems. It is possible that further research, particularly in highly productive environments or when conditions are more favourable, may prove acoustics to be a useful tool for assisting in monitoring primary productivity in seaweed communities.",2020-03-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

Georeferenced habitat maps can improve management of isolated tropical coastal and marine ecosystems, where rapid unsustainable anthropogenic coastal development often occurs. In this study, SSS was employed to map subtidal marine habitats of Principe Island (Gulf of Guinea, West Africa) to determine areas of especial interest for biodiversity or marine resource conservation. The SSS methodology was applied, during the BIO-Principe Scientific Expedition (2016), in four target areas, both inside and outside its UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, covering 675 ha between 3 and 30 m depth, also combining SCUBA diving and video transects. These areas were chosen based on their geographical location and habitat information, provided by the local stakeholders. Over the total surface mapped, five main habitats were recorded: sandy seabeds (flat sandbanks and rippled sandbanks), rhodolith seabeds (rhodoliths interspersed with scleractinian coral colonies and macroalgae), biogenic (mud/sedimentary) seabeds, and rocky seabed (bedrock and rocky reefs). In the northern, eastern, and southern areas of the island, sandy bottoms with ripples, interspersed with small biogenic sedimentary beds and rhodolith bottoms predominated. The southwestern area, Baia das Agulhas, concentrated the greatest variability and richness of habitats, including the largest rhodolith seascape. This study provided a consistent and detailed dataset to support the creation and design of future MPAs, already planned by the Principe's government, adding including essential information on areas containing key habitats (e.g. rhodoliths) not detected in previous reports.

While traditional field mapping techniques, such as towed video and diver surveys, are still commonly employed for generating highly detailed maps of seafloor habitat, acoustic and satellite remote sensing have proven to be efficient alternatives for generating habitat maps. To date remote sensing using satellite imagery has dominated mapping efforts over coral reefs and other tropical ecosystems with fewer studies applied in temperate marine regions where acoustic studies are more common. Few studies exist that have assessed the performance of high resolution satellite imagery in mapping seafloor habitat in temperate regions. This paper compares the efficacy of high resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) and a single-beam acoustic ground discrimination system (QTC View V) for mapping the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation at a site within the Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area (GHNMCA) off the north coast of British Columbia, Canada. Ground-truth data for training and validation were collected using a towed underwater video camera. Prior to classification the WorldView-2 image (8 bands, 2 m resolution) was processed following orthorectification, atmospheric correction, glint correction, land and optically deep water masking. An acoustic survey was conducted using a 200 kHz echosounder and data were processed and interpolated using QTC IMPACT software. The WorldView-2 imagery performed best in mapping habitat in regions shallower than 3 m, obtaining a total accuracy 75%, where it could identify the distribution of green algae (Ulva spp.), brown algae (Fucus spp.) and eelgrass (Zostera marina). The 200 kHz data were unable to detect the distribution of brown and green algae but were able to map the distribution of eelgrass as well as a subtidal red algae (Chondrocanthus exasperatus) (total accuracy 80%). A final habitat map containing all habitat types present at the study site was produced using the output from both datasets. The study resulted in recommendations for remote mapping of submerged vegetation in temperate coastal area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

This effort has resulted in two big data challenges: (1) the curation, management, and global dissemination of passive acoustic datasets and (2) efficiently extracting critical information and comparing it to other datasets in the context of ecosystem-based research and management. To address the former, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information recently established an archive for passive acoustic data. This fast-growing archive currently contains over 100 TB of passive acoustic audio files mainly collected from stationary recorders throughout waters in the United States. These datasets are documented with standards-based metadata and are freely available to the public. To begin to address the latter, through standardized processing and centralized stewardship and access, we provide a previously unattainable comparison of first order sound level-patterns from archived data collected across three distinctly separate long-term passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) efforts conducted at regional and national scales: NOAA/National Park Service Ocean Noise Reference Station Network, the Atlantic Deepwater Ecosystem Observatory Network, and the Sanctuary Soundscape Monitoring Project. Nine sites were selected from these projects covering the Alaskan Arctic, Northeast and Central Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Mid and Northwest Atlantic. Sites could generally be categorized into those strongly influenced by anthropogenic noise (e.g., vessel traffic) and those that were not. Higher sound levels, specifically for lower frequencies (< 125 Hz), and proximity to densely populated coastal zones were common characteristics of sites influenced by anthropogenic noise. Conversely, sites with lower overall sound levels and away from dense populations resulted in soundscape patterns influenced by biological sources. Seasonal variability in sound levels across selected decidecade bands was apparent for most sites and often represented changes in the presence or behavior of sound-producing species. This first order examination of levels across projects highlights the utility of these initial metrics to identify patterns that can then be examined in more detail. Finally, to help the PAM community collectively and collaboratively move forward, we propose the next frontier for scalable data stewardship, access, and processing flow.",2021-07-14,Bruna,Excluded,"Bioacoustics,Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",

A detailed radiative transfer model was obtained by in situ measurement of optical parameters that then allowed calibration of the IKONOS image against in situ optical measurements and a series of ground-truthing points. Eight benthic classes were distinguished optically with an overall accuracy of 69% and a Tau index T of 65. The classification of the IKONOS image allowed discrimination of three different coral assemblages (dense live, dense dead, sparse), which were confirmed by ground-truthing. Data evaluation of the acoustic surveys involved culling of datapoints with < 90% confidence and < 30% probability, two QTC-provided statistics, and the deletion of data classes without clear spatial patterns (visualized by single-class trackplots). The deletion of these ubiquitous classes was necessary in order to obtain any clearly interpretable spatial pattern of echo classes after the surveys were resampled to a regular grid and areas between the lines interpolated using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The 50 kHz acoustic seafloor classification was able to determine two classes (unconsolidated sand versus hardground) but was not able to determine corals. The 200 kHz survey determined high rugosity (=corals and sand ripples) versus low rugosity (=flat areas) but was not able to determine consolidated and unconsolidated sediments. Classes were extrapolated to the entire grid and polygons obtained from the two surveys were combined to provide maps containing four classes (rugose hardground=coral, flat hardground=rock, rugose softground=ripples and algae, flat softground=bare sand). Compared with the classification map derived from the IKONOS image, they were 66% accurate (T=59) when the most highly processed data (only selected classes, > 90% accuracy and > 30% probability) were used, and 60% accurate (T=53) when less processed data (selected classes only, all data) were used. Accuracy against ground-truthing points of the most highly processed dataset was 56% (T=46). These results indicate that results from optical and acoustic surveys have some degree of commonality. Therefore, there is a potential to produce maps outlining coral areas from optical remote-sensing in shallow areas and acoustic methods in adjacent deeper areas beyond optical resolution with the limitation that acoustic maps will resolve fewer habitat classes and have lower accuracy.

The soundscape analysis, in terms of collection and analysis of acoustic signals, has been proposed as a tool to evaluate the specific features of ecological assemblages and to estimate their acoustic variability over space and time. This study aimed to characterise the Capo Caccia-Isola Piana Marine Protected Area (Italy, Western Mediterranean Sea) soundscape over short temporal (few days) and spatial scales (few km) and to quantify the main anthropogenic and biological components, with a focus on fish biophonies.        Methods: Within the MPA, three sites were chosen each in a different protection zone (A for the integral protection, B as the partial protection, and C as the general protection). In each site, two underwater autonomous acoustic recorders were deployed in July 2020 at a depth of about 10 m on rocky bottoms. To characterise the contribution of both biophonies and anthrophonies, sea ambient noise (SAN) levels were measured as sound pressure level (SPL dB re: 1 mu Pa-rms) at eight 1/3 octave bands, centred from 125 Hz to 16 kHz, and biological and anthropogenic sounds were noted. Fish sounds were classified and counted following a catalogue of known fish sounds from the Mediterranean Sea based on the acoustic characteristic of sound types. A contemporary fish visual census had been carried out at the test sites.        Results: SPL were different by site, time (day vs. night), and hour. SPLs bands centred at 125, 250, and 500 Hz were significantly higher in the daytime, due to the high number of boats per minute whose noise dominated the soundscapes. The loudest man-made noise was found in the A zone, followed by the B and the C zone, confirming that MPA current regulations do not provide protection from acoustic pollution. The dominant biological components of the MPA soundscape were the impulsive sounds generated by some invertebrates, snapping shrimps and fish. The vast majority of fish sounds were recorded at the MPA site characterized by the highest sound richness, abundance, and Shannon-Wiener index, coherently with the results of a fish visual census. Moreover, the acoustic monitoring detected a sound associated with a cryptic species (Ophidion spp.) never reported in the study area before, further demonstrating the usefulness of passive acoustic monitoring as a complementary technique to species census.

Detection and mapping of living coral reefs and mounds have been carried out by means of multibeam bathymetty, backscatter images, ultra-high resolution and highresolution multichannel seismic reflection data and sampling. In addition, profiling CTDs have been made to characterise environmental conditions as temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen contents of the coral sites. Based on these dataset, two main provinces of cold-water coral mounds and reefs have been identified in the Galicia Bank at water depths between 620 and 1125 m. The Breogham Mound Province along the western flank of the Galicia Bank shows a sequence of well-developed mounds composed of: (1) Stepped semi-buried elongated mounds, the tallest mounds with heights up 70 m and widths of 450 m lined up in along-slope trending ridges and intercalated with upslope migrating sediment drifts at water depths from 1125 to 826 m; (2) Single and composite seabed mounds show heights of 10-12 m and average widths of 100 m at 825 and 780 m water depths and (3) Lophelia reefs forming mini-mounds 2-4 m high and 80-100 m width growing on a flat erosional surface at the summit of the bank at 780-750 m water depths. Otherwise, the Castelao Mound Province at the eastern flank of the bank is mainly constituted by cluster of mini-mounds hosting living Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata reefs. These living reefs are detected based on ultra-high resolutions parametric echosounders as mini-mounds with an acoustically transparent interior. Otherwise, semi-buried and exposed mounds are mapped with a combination of multibeam and backscatter images identified by their high strength values and seabed expression. We conclude that the initiation, growth and distribution of coldwater coral mounds on the Galicia Bank have been controlled by the following environmental forcing factors: (i) water masses with a potential density resulted of the turbulent boundary between the Mediterranean Outflow and the intermediate Atlantic water masses which allowed the transport of coral larvae along the NE Atlantic margins (ii) the formation of a hard substrate, possibly related to subsurface fluid flow, necessary for the initial settle of coral larvae and (iii) the turbulences created by the Mediterranean flow impinging the topography of the bank creating suitable currents that favour intrusion of the nutrient afflux from the Atlantic mass waters to deep waters allowing to coral colonies to growth.

Recent advances in control volume [1] and benthic boundary layer eddy correlation methods 12, 31 promise to make continuous non-invasive measurements of net oxygen community production and respiration a reality. These methods, however, cannot be extended to the measurement of calcification rate because no suitable sensor for the measurement of total alkalinity (TA) exists at the present time. We have a solution that is based on measuring the vertical gradients in current velocity and the chemical constituent of interest in the boundary layer. The vertical gradient in velocity gives us K-z and K times delta C/delta z gives us the flux of constituent C into or out of the seafloor. The method can be applied to the measurement of calcification but could also be applied to the measurement of the flux of any chemical or biological constituent that can be determined from a water sample, in this case O-2. Water samples could be collected with an automated water sampler preferably slowly over the period of an hour so that high frequency variability that cannot be sampled would be averaged out. Here we present preliminary data using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV), Modular Acoustic Velocity Sensor (MAVS) and two Aanderaa oxygen optodes. Three test deployments were made on shallow, warm-water coral reefs in La Parguera, Puerto Rico. Time series of net production obtained using the boundary layer gradient flux method (GF) were compared with measurements based on the Eulerian upstream-downstream flow respirometry method and a 1-D water column mass balance method with air-sea gas exchange.

Ocean gliders are growing in importance as components of ocean observing systems, extending measurements of physical oceanography beyond those possible with moorings and expensive oceanographic research vessels. Payloads are typically composed of conductivity, temperature and pressure along with optical measures of chlorophyll reflectance and dissolved organics. The small size and low power consumption of such echo sounders now makes it practical to install them in gliders, providing the means to simultaneously measure biological metrics through the water column over extended areas and linking physical properties and primary productivity to higher trophic levels such as zooplankton and fish.        We have recently installed single-beam echo-sounders with up to four acoustic frequencies in gliders. The echo-sounder (ASL Environmental Sciences' AZFP) was designed as an autonomous, moored instrument, and several modifications, mechanical, electronic and software were required to adapt it to installation and operation in gliders. The existing lower- frequency transducers were too large and heavy for the glider; their size was reduced by increasing the beam-width, and the housings were redesigned to reduce weight and improve their profile to reduce drag. The transducer housings are designed to be mounted at an angle on the vehicle body so that they are aimed vertically down during the dive phase. Several modifications were also made to the electronics chassis and shrouds to reduce weight, and the power connection was altered to operate from the vehicle battery rather than its own dedicated supply. Examples of these design alterations will be discussed. The instrument operating software was modified to allow communication and control from the vehicle, although data storage remained in the AZFP itself. In the initial case, a 200 kHz, single-beam echo-sounder was integrated and calibrated in a Slocum Webb electric ocean glider. Calibration and controlled field tests demonstrated reasonable signal-to-noise ratio, allowing for detection of plankton and fishes to greater than 75m range. The noise background was higher than that found when the AZFP is used as an autonomous unit, so improvements to noise isolation in the glider should be able to improve the signal to noise ratio in future. A data analysis workflow was developed that estimates glider position and orientation underwater to correct for depth and range of targets. Trial missions in the eastern Gulf of Mexico traveled over a submerged pipeline and a rocky reef. Acoustic backscatter signals attributed to mid-water plankton layers were co-located with oceanographic features and peaks in chlorophyll. Schools of pelagic and demersal fishes were detected and mapped over charted seafloor features.        To date, three multiple frequency versions have been built and integrated into Slocum Webb G2 gliders. Several 3-frequency AZFP (38, 70 and 125 kHz) will be used to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of krill biomass in the Antarctic. Several 4-frequency instruments (125, 200, 455 and 769 kHz) have been built to study whales. A glider with a 3-frequency AZFP (38, 125 and 200 kHz) combination was deployed in Terra Nova Bay (western Ross Sea) and mapped the vertical and horizontal distribution and abundance of zooplankton and pelagic silverfish. Future developments will be aimed at adapting the AZFP to other autonomous vehicles and to reducing the effects of the vehicle's internal noise environment. Ultimately, this glider-based acoustic technology will pave the way for cost-effective, automated examination of food webs and ecosystems in regions throughout the global ocean.",2018-01-01,Bruna,Excluded,"Not acoustic telemetry,__EXR__Not acoustic telemetry",
