However, most studies have focused on the diurnal component of these aspects; nocturnal patterns are less known. Our study aims to address this knowledge gap by assessing diel movement patterns in ecologically and commercially important nocturnal coral reef fishes. We evaluate 122-days of acoustic telemetry data from 4 nocturnal species in 2 coral reef fish families (Haemulidae and Lutjanidae) on the Great Barrier Reef. For all species, we found a clear division between daytime resting areas on the reef and a move towards off-reef areas at night. This was highlighted in the low number of detections at night and the high average transitions between receivers at twilight. Over our study period, average nocturnal space use area (minimum convex polygon) of Plectorhincus gibbosus was 328,089 m2, Plectorhincus lineatus 28,828 m2, and Lutjanus carponotatus 20,369 m2. However, results from a Principal Component Analysis revealed that space use, and movement, varied substantially within species; for 3 of the 4 species the main axis of variation correlated with individual-level behaviour. These large differences in individual space use patterns highlight the need for caution when using species averages when considering ecosystem functions. Overall, our preliminary observations provide a glimpse into the large spatial extent, potential habitat connectivity, and intra and interspecific variation in activity patterns among large nocturnal Indo-Pacific reef fishes. This highlights their potential importance in maintaining ecosystem links between coral reefs and adjacent habitats.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  81 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00338-024-02573-x,Diel patterns;Intraspecific variation;Behaviour;Space use;Function;Habitat;GRUNTS HAEMULIDAE;SITE FIDELITY;HABITAT USE;BEHAVIOR;SHIFTS;DIVERSITY;ECOSYSTEM;SEASCAPE;SHELTER;IMPACTS,,

Despite their increased use in recent years, the choice of structures used at artificial reefs remains largely haphazard due to the lack of information on reef structure performance. Few studies have examined the use of different artificial reef structures by individual fish. From 2021-2022, we acoustically tagged 72 black sea bass (Centropristis striata), 34 gag (Mycteroperca mircrolepis), 27 greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), nine almaco jack (S. rivoliana), and eight red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) on four artificial reef complexes near Cape Lookout, North Carolina, U.S. Available artificial reef structures consisted of materials of various sizes and heights made of concrete and metal. We tracked tagged fish using a fine-scale positioning system for similar to 100 days. Black sea bass exhibited high site fidelity to the artificial structure where we caught them, rarely moving away from that structure. The limited movement resulted in low transition probabilities; we conclude that black sea bass do not select for particular artificial structures. Gag and red snapper moved greater distances away from artificial structures and routinely moved between them. Greater amberjack and almaco jack moved the most within the complexes displaying circling behavior around individual structures and were the only species that regularly moved off the artificial reef complexes. Greater amberjack movements away from artificial sites were most commonly directed to surrounding shipwrecks. Whereas gag, red snapper, almaco jack, and greater amberjack used all available structures, they consistently selected for high relief structures, such as vessels, more than other structures. These results will be useful to managers charged with decisions on what types of structures to place at artificial reef complexes to supplement or enhance habitat for economically important fishes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Artificial reefs | USER-NOTES: {""Bruna""=>[""Artificial reef""]}",10.3389/fmars.2024.1373494     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),artificial reef;habitat selection;telemetry;fish tagging;fine-scale habitat use;BLACK-SEA BASS;SNAPPER LUTJANUS-CAMPECHANUS;TRIGGERFISH BALISTES-CAPRISCUS;RED SNAPPER;HABITAT USE;CENTROPRISTIS-STRIATA;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;SITE FIDELITY;ASSEMBLAGES,,

The 370,200 detections of 57 seabass in the study area revealed high residency in the period from late March-May to September-November, as well as high site fidelity (70.7%). Whereas the majority of seabass left the area in winter, 13 seabass stayed in the harbour experiencing temperatures as low as 2.8 & DEG;C. Two groups of seabass were identified having different core movement areas in the inner and outer harbours, although movement between the two areas was possible. The distinct differences in habitat use between these groups resulted in a significantly different level of exposure to fisheries under the same policy framework.

Once relatively common throughout Florida and the Caribbean, the species; is now considered vulnerable (i.e., threatened with extinction) due to overfishing and loss of juvenile mangrove habitat. Goliath grouper in the southeastern US form annual spawning aggregations on high-relief reefs located offshore of both the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida, US. To determine spawning site fidelity and describe migration patterns to aggregations, we implanted 50 adult goliath grouper with acoustic transmitter tags from 2010 to 2013. Fish were tagged at known spawning sites off the Florida Atlantic coast and tracked as they moved through the FACT Network array of acoustic receivers. From 2010 to 2020, we collected similar to 7 million detections from tagged goliath grouper at 153 sites along the southeastern US Atlantic coast. Results of this long-term tracking indicate that adult goliath grouper are relatively sedentary during non-spawning months (Nov to June) but move significantly more prior to, during, and immediately after spawning (July to Oct). Inter-annual spawning site fidelity was high: between 80-93% of tagged fish returned to the same spawning sites each year. Arrival timing at spawning sites coincided with the August new moon, with males arriving earlier than females. Some individuals migrated distances greater than 400-km per year, with observed migration rates of up to 44-km per day prior to spawning. Long-term tagging data are critical for understanding movement patterns and developing management strategies for this species of special conservation concern.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  56 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Spawning",10.3390/fishes8080398     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),movement;spawning aggregations;acoustic telemetry;Epinephelus itajara;EPINEPHELUS-ITAJARA;EASTERN GULF;SOUND PRODUCTION;AGGREGATIONS;PATTERNS;DEFINITIONS;TELEMETRY;AGE,,

One of the most important tourism sectors in aquatic environments is scuba diving, an activity considered sustainable given its non-extractive nature and capability of bringing relevant socio-economic benefits to local communities. However, knowledge about its impact on the activity patterns of aquatic animals is still scarce. Here, we used biotelemetry techniques to assess the importance of scuba diving in modulating the activity patterns of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus, Lowe, 1834), a marine predatory fish of high interest for fishing and tourism. We implemented Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on high-resolution acceleration data using a temporal and spatial control while controlling for a set of environmental variables (i.e. photoperiod, time-of-day, moon phase, temperature, wave height, and intensity and direction of marine currents) within a multiple-use marine protected area, and diving tourism hot-spot, of the western Mediterranean Sea. Our results underlined the more decisive influence of environmental-related stressors on the activity patterns of the dusky grouper compared to the impact of scuba diving. A high heterogeneity existed in the response against most of the stressors, including the presence of scuba divers. Overall, the activity of dusky grouper was higher at night than at day, showing a positive relationship with wave height, water temperature, and current intensity and a negative one with the moon phase. Remarkably, our findings, based on novel biotelemetry tools, differed substantially from the common wisdom accepted for this species. In conclusion, there is no clear evidence of scuba divers influence on the general activity patterns of the dusky grouper. Beyond their relevance from an ecological perspective, these results provide useful insights for the sustainable management of coastal resources, suggesting that scuba diving, when properly carried out, can represent an important sector to foster for the blue growth of coastal communities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  71 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118491,Accelerometers;Acoustic telemetry;Biologging;Human-disturbance;Rocky-reef fish;Fish behaviour;GROUPER EPINEPHELUS-MARGINATUS;FORECASTING SYSTEM;HABITAT USE;MOVEMENT;PERCEPTIONS;SERRANIDAE;BEHAVIOR;ECOLOGY;DIVERS;SOCIB,,

However, few studies have focused on the fine-scale movements related to reproduction, a key feature in a population's perpetuation. Knowledge of movements modulated by reproduction is particularly important since migrations towards spawning grounds may increase the vulnerability to threats if these occur outside protected areas. Further, reproductive behavioural polymorphism is widely understudied but may affect reproductive success. In this work, we used acoustic telemetry to study a harvested fish, Diplodus sargus, within a small no-take zone in Portugal. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to focus on both the environmental and spatial features affecting D. sargus reproduction and the first to explore intraspecific variability of spawning movements. We report, during the spawning period, short-term (<1 d) and synchronised wider movements towards the open sea and deeper areas-'extraordinary movements'-involving 34% of the individuals. These extraordinary movements were associated with environmental factors known to trigger reproduction in this species (low but increasing photoperiod and temperature, waxing and full moon phases). Our results suggest that different behavioural groups (residents, commuters and low site-attached fish) exhibiting differences in spatial use may aggregate and spawn simultaneously, which may contribute to the maintenance of behavioural polymorphisms and the species' evolutionary adaptability. These findings have implications for the conservation of D. sargus and are relevant to other species that also conduct such critical migrations. Our results should enable adaptive management of fisheries targeting this species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  77 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning",10.3354/meps14266     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine protected area;White seabream;Acoustic telemetry;Reproductive behaviour;Extraordinary movements;Intraspecific variation;SEA BREAM;MARINE RESERVES;HABITAT USE;LUNAR SYNCHRONIZATION;REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY;PARTIAL MIGRATION;PROTECTED AREAS;SITE FIDELITY;HOME RANGES;REEF FISH,,

One of the most fundamental unresolved issues in understanding animal navigation is how the brain represents spatial information. Although navigation has been studied extensively in many taxa, the key efforts to determine the neural basis of navigation have focused on mammals, usually in lab experiments, where the allocated space is typically very small; e.g., up to one order of magnitude the size of the animal, is limited by artificial walls, and contains only a few objects. This type of setting is vastly different from the habitat of animals in the wild, which is open in many cases and is virtually limitless in size compared to its inhabitants. Thus, a fundamental open question in animal navigation is whether small-scale, spatially confined, and artificially crafted lab experiments indeed reveal how navigation is enacted in the real world. This question is difficult to study given the technical problems associated with in vivo electrophysiology in natural settings. Here, we argue that these difficulties can be overcome by implementing state of the art technology when studying the rivulated rabbitfish, Siganus rivulatus as the model animal. As a first step toward this goal, using acoustic tracking of the reef, we demonstrate that individual S. rivulatus have a defined home range of about 200 m in length, from which they seldom venture. They repeatedly visit the same areas and return to the same sleeping grounds, thus providing evidence for their ability to navigate in the reef environment. Using a clustering algorithm to analyze segments of daily trajectories, we found evidence of specific repeating patterns in behavior within the home range of individual fish. Thus, S. rivulatus appears to have the ability to carry out its daily routines and revisit places of interest by employing sophisticated means of navigation while exploring its surroundings. In the future, using novel technologies for wireless recording from single cells of fish brains, S. rivulatus can emerge as an ideal system to study the neural basis of navigation in natural settings and lead to ""electrophysiology in the wild.""","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  35 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3389/fncir.2022.895381     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),navigation;electrophysiology;rabbitfish;coral reef;Siganus rivulatus;HEAD-DIRECTION;REPRESENTATION;CELLS;HIPPOCAMPUS;MECHANISMS;FOREBRAIN;MAP,,

To do so, visual surveys were performed on protected and unprotected reefs between 2016 and 2017. Moreover, 20 gray parrotfish Sparisoma axillare and 9 Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored from December 2016 to October 2017. For both species, fish densities were significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost. The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs, predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were small (0.10 to 0.45 km(2)), and both species presented spatially segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88% for S. axillare and 95% for L. alexandrei.

We examine long-term space-use dynamics in parrotfish (median duration: 359 days) by tracking 23 terminal-males of three species along a coral reef in the Northern Red Sea Gulf of Aqaba. We used acoustic telemetry to track horizontal movement along the reef, depth, and activity (through tri-axial accelerometers), and quantify the effect of environmental factors such as water temperature and algal abundance on long-term patterns. We found that in the species examined, nearly all individuals maintained a highly consistent spatial pattern throughout the study duration, in which they repeatedly moved along a distinct route between nighttime sleeping areas and spatially constrained daytime areas. Individual patterns were surprisingly conserved over time, despite seasonal changes and variation in resource abundance. Individuals differed considerably in their daily travel distance, with some traveling up to 2000 m along the reef, while others moved only between deep and shallow areas. Activity levels consistently peaked around mid-day, regardless of the location of their daytime areas, which behavioral surveys confirm are associated with feeding activities. We also detected peaks in activity during early mornings when surveys detect that parrotfish interacted in large aggregates (typically 30-60 individuals). Our findings indicate that space-use patterns vary among individuals but are extremely conservative within individuals over long time periods. This in turn may have important consequences to the health of reefs, as individual parrotfish may be less likely to alter foraging patterns as conditions change. Furthermore, the high fidelity to limited sleeping and daytime areas may be a source of concern, as local small-scale disturbances may strongly disrupt individual space-use patterns.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  111 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Herbivorous fish",10.1007/s00338-022-02258-3,Space-use;Herbivory;Individual behavioral variation;Parrotfish;Site fidelity;Telemetry;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;SITE FIDELITY;PHASE-SHIFTS;CORAL-REEFS;SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY;INDIVIDUAL VARIATION;BEHAVIORAL SYNDROMES;FORAGING BEHAVIOR;HOME-RANGE;FISH,,

Results from both methods showed that this species is likely to be a temporary resident on shallow inshore reefs; fish showed high site fidelity and occupied relatively small home ranges for periods seldom exceeding 12 months, whereafter they appeared to undertake ranging-type movements. Adults >400 mm total length were more mobile than juveniles, and the distance moved increased with both fish size and time at liberty. Adults south of Durban, South Africa, moved farther in a northerly direction than those north of Durban, confirming that spawning likely takes place north of Durban. No direct evidence of a spawning migration was found, but anecdotal reports that they form spawning aggregations suggests that migrations for this purpose are likely to occur. The current species-specific linefish regulations and the recently expanded marine protected area network along the east coast of South Africa are believed to be adequate to ensure the future sustainable use of this species. However, improved enforcement of regulations is required, and identification of spawning aggregation sites should be a research priority.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Reef-associated,Mixed techniques",10.2989/1814232X.2022.2064548     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),passive acoustic telemetry;Pondoland MPA;iSimangaliso MPA;reef fish;site fidelity;tag and recapture;MARINE PROTECTED AREA;PROTOGYNOUS HERMAPHRODITE;PARTIAL MIGRATION;PATTERNS;FISHES;COAST;DIVERSITY;ABUNDANCE;GROUPERS;LINEFISH,,

Tracking lionfish at this scale revealed that home range size is 3-20 times larger than previously estimated and varies more than 8-fold across individuals (similar to 48 000-379 000 m(2); average: 101 000 m(2)), with estimates insensitive to assumptions about potential mortality for low-movement individuals. Lionfish move far greater distances than previously reported, with 37% of fish traveling >1 km from the initial tagging site toward deeper habitats, and 1 individual moving similar to 10 km during a 10 d period. Movement rates, home range size, and maximum distance traveled were not related to lionfish size (18-35 cm total length) or lunar phase. Lionfish movement was lowest at night and greatest during crepuscular periods, with fish acceleration (m s(-2)) increasing with water temperature during these times. Our results help reconcile observed patterns of rapid recolonization following lionfish removal, and suggest complex drivers likely result in highly variable patterns of movement for similarly sized fish occupying the same habitat. Culling areas >= the average lionfish home range size identified here (i.e. similar to 10 ha) or habitat patches isolated by >= similar to 180 m (radius of average home range) may minimize subsequent recolonization. If the shallow-deep long-distance movements observed here are unidirectional, mesophotic habitats may require culling at relatively greater frequencies to counteract ongoing migration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3354/meps13818     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Animal movement;Home range size;Habitat use;Acoustic telemetry;Invasive species;Population control;Marine conservation;NONNATIVE MARINE FISHES;INDO-PACIFIC LIONFISH;PTEROIS-VOLITANS;RED LIONFISH;HABITAT USE;SIZE;MANAGEMENT;BEHAVIOR;GROUPER;ARRAY,,

We analysed similar to 2 million detections for 23 species, ranging from reef fish such as Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus, Serranidae) to migratory apex predators such as white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias, Lamnidae). To facilitate comparisons across species, we used an eco-evolutionary movement strategy framework that identified measurable movement traits and their proximate and ultimate drivers. Detectability was species-specific and quantified with a detection potential index. Life stages detected in the study area varied by species and residency varied with life stage. Four annual movement types were identified as follows: high site-fidelity residents, range residents, seasonal migrants and general migrants. The endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata, Pristidae), a seasonal migrant, exhibited the greatest within-ecosystem connectivity. Site attachment, stopover and deep-water migration behaviours differed between individuals, species and annual movement types. All apex predators were migratory. General migrants were significantly larger than fish in the other movement types, a life-history and movement trait combination that is common but not exclusive, as many small pelagics also migrate. Most teleosts exhibited movements associated with spawning. As concerns grow over habitat and biodiversity loss, multispecies movescapes, such as presented here, are expected to play an increasingly important role in informing ecosystem-based and non-extractive fisheries management strategies.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  34     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  124 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1111/faf.12589,acoustic telemetry;Florida Keys;migration;movement ecology;network analysis;space use;ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;SCOMBEROMORUS-CAVALLA;FISHERIES MANAGEMENT;SMALLTOOTH SAWFISH;GREATER AMBERJACK;SPATIAL ECOLOGY;BLACKTIP SHARKS;KING MACKEREL;RED DRUM,,

Two tags were detected leaving the study area by day 35, indicating predation or emigration. Three tags became inactive within the array, indicating tag loss or fish death. Six ""resident"" fish inhabited the array for 246-326 days. Resident fish exhibited high site fidelity, small home ranges (mean 95% KDE = 4907 m(2)), and consistent activity patterns for the duration of the summertime high-resolution array (5 months), except during seasonal hypoxia. Resident fish were strongly diurnal in summer, with high levels of daytime activity above the bottom in relatively rugose habitat, followed by nighttime rest periods in deeper, less rugose habitat. During summertime hypoxia, resident fish exhibited less daytime activity during daytime hours with no rest periods at night, inhabited shallower water depths, and moved well away from their core activity areas on long, erratic forays. During the winter, diel patterns were less evident with higher activity levels at night (than in the summer) and lower activity levels in the day (than in the summer).

Most home ranges had a habitat composition dominated by seagrass and to a lesser degree, coral reef and/or pavement. Nighttime activity spaces were distinct from but contained within daytime areas. Conclusions: Mutton snapper showed strong site fidelity to home ranges in Brewers Bay. Two individuals that were absent from the array for more than a few hours were detected at separate arrays at spawning aggregation sites.

Small (60-100 cm FL) and large (>100 cm FL) adult fish appeared to favour shallow coral reefs and associated reef drop offs whilst sharing a similar core home range location. Large adult fish utilized a greater diversity of habitat types and had significantly (p < 0.05) greater annual dispersal distances (mean = 35.29 km, max = 91.32 km) than small adults (mean = 13.72 km, max = 21.55 km).

Nonetheless, there is very little information available on the feeding ecology of this species. In this study, the authors used acoustic telemetry to detect the diel vertical movement patterns of S. ovifrons, video survey to detect its feeding depths and substrata and focal follow survey and genetic analysis to identify algae composition on the feeding scars at Kashiwajima Island, southwestern Japan (32 degrees 46 ' N, 132 degrees 38 ' E). Acoustic telemetry revealed that S. ovifrons spent most of its time in shallow water (<10 m) during the day and slept in deeper water (10-15 m) at night. Video and focal follow surveys revealed that most fishes of various sizes regularly took bites on epilithic algae and detrital materials on rocky substrata at depths of <10 m, but large fishes (>40 cm total length) sometimes took bites directly on live corals (Acropora solitaryensis) at the 5 m depth zone where live tabular corals dominated the benthos. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that epilithic algae collected from feeding scars were mainly composed of Rhodophyta, and coralline algae were less often targeted. Overall, this study revealed that S. ovifrons feeds mostly at depths <10 m, and the feeding algae substrata of the species are similar to those of tropical coral reef parrotfishes.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1111/jfb.14704,feeding behaviour;feeding substrata;scarinine parrotfish;temperate reef;vertical movements;NOMINALLY HERBIVOROUS FISHES;DE-NORONHA ARCHIPELAGO;GREAT-BARRIER-REEF;EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY;ARTIFICIAL REEFS;EPILITHIC ALGAL;ECOSYSTEM ROLES;CORAL-REEFS;HABITAT-USE;PATTERNS,,

In order to improve management strategies for this critically endangered species, it is necessary to understand the spatial ecology of the species across seasons and years. In the Cayman Islands, we used a multi-year, presence/absence, depth-coded acoustic tagging dataset of Nassau grouper to characterize patterns in the species' behavior and vertical habitat use at home reef sites. Twenty acoustically tagged individuals (56-84 cm, 70.01 +/- 7.40 cm; total length, mean +/- SD) maintained consistent home reef sites, although some fish regularly shifted activity centers within the home site, often following a seasonal spawning migration. Seven fish with depth-coded tags showed a higher probability of vertical movement in the hours immediately following dawn and preceding dusk. We found evidence of a positive relationship between the fish condition factor and depth of home reef site.

Our study focused on three species (Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus microrhinos and Scarus ghobban), including a total of 30 fish. Fish were kept outside their natural environment for several days before release for pre- and post-tagging surveys. Moreover, 47% of them were not released at their capture site. Half of all individuals (all species) showed a high level of side fidelity immediately upon release. During this period, they were detected in the same place, by a small and constant number of hydrophones. This site fidelity pattern was also observed for the other fish (50%; all species) but after 1 to 18 days of an unsettled pattern, during which the fish moved significantly along the reef slope (high activity). During this short period, the distances travelled were significantly higher than during the subsequent period of site fidelity (several km vs. a few hundred m). We hypothesize that these unsettled patterns might result from fish experimental displacement (homing behavior) and from post-capture captivity (the fish had to recover a niche within the ecosystem). Consequently, we suggest that fish be released where they were caught to limit the movements associated with homing behavior. Periods of captivity should be avoided as much as possible. If this is not possible, a minimum acclimatization period of two or three weeks should be taken into account when analyzing the data.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  4     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  27 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10641-020-01049-5,Acoustic telemetry;Fish behavior;Homing behavior;Tagging impact;Captivity impact;New Caledonia;TROUT PLECTROPOMUS-LEOPARDUS;SNAPPER PAGRUS-AURATUS;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;HOME-RANGE;HABITAT UTILIZATION;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;SITE FIDELITY;SPACE USE;COMMUNITIES;PERIOD,,

They aggregate at shallow offshore seamounts, and largely share diet preferences, but very little is known about how habitat and resources are shared by these predators intra- and inter-specifically. Here we use long-term (over 3 yr) passive acoustic telemetry to investigate the patterns of activity, space use and associative behaviour at an isolated, small shallow seamount. By quantifying fine-scale spatiotemporal overlaps and performing null model randomization tests, we found evidence of non-random associations, mostly between conspecifics of both species, as well as shifts in diel and seasonal patterns of space occupancy. Both species were detected more often during spring, and appear to be more active during daytime, suggesting the absence of fine-scale temporal habitat partitioning. Additionally, we found evidence of size-dependent spatial behaviour in almaco jack, with similarly sized individuals co-occurring more often and larger specimens being more infrequently detected. This study quantitatively assesses individual associations using solely presence-absence data collected through passive acoustic telemetry, showing the potential of this approach in a broader application to a significant number of past and ongoing studies, even if many were not originally designed to study this important aspect of fish ecology.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  73 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3354/meps13501     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Yellowmouth barracuda;Almaco jack;Acoustic telemetry;Space use;Association dynamics;Aggregations;Spatial overlap;BARRACUDA SPHYRAENA-BARRACUDA;PSEUDOCARANX-DENTEX;AZORES ARCHIPELAGO;SHANNON ENTROPY;AQUATIC ANIMALS;SPACE USE;PATTERNS;BEHAVIOR;HABITAT;COMMUNITIES,,

Broad-scale results inferred from network analysis revealed that all individuals had core use receivers along the shallow shelf break situated west of Buck Island, preferring an area that was coarsely characterized by sand and seagrass benthic habitats. Fine-scale results using Euclidean distance analysis (EDA) suggested fish positions occurred randomly or independent of benthic habitat type. Further exploration of positioning data suggested that there were two contingents or groups of fish displaying unique movement patterns within the fine-scale positioning array. Individuality in space and habitat use was thus masked when using an EDA approach at the study population level, as it was also missed during broad-scale analyses. Discrepancies between broad- and fine-scale habitat inferences suggest that positioning systems are necessary for interpreting habitat use in complex coral reef ecosystems. Nested positioning systems appear to add substantial information that is not obtainable using broad-scale data alone, and caution is necessary in inferring habitat use when only coarse-scale location data are available.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  10     Cited Reference Count:  57 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1002/mcf2.10119     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),CONTRASTING MOVEMENTS;CONNECTIVITY;VISUALIZATION;PATTERNS;TRACKING;BAY,,

Passive acoustic telemetry was used to infer movement patterns of seven adult C. latus within Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a no-take marine protected area (MPA) northeast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, a preliminary exploration of detections recorded outside of BIRNM was used to gain knowledge of the potential for larger scale movements. Ascertaining long-term movement patterns, including residency, mobility, and identifying core activity spaces can play a considerable role in how MPAs, like BIRNM, are adapted to meet the needs of mobile species.ResultsHigh residency index values were observed for individual C. latus within the BIRNM array (meanSE: 0.913 +/- 0.04, range 0.75-1.0) across the 17 months monitored. Most fish were also detected on receivers located outside BIRNM. An observed to expected detection ratio revealed that despite high residency, only 9.6% of expected transmissions were detected based on the average tag transmission rate. Network analysis revealed high individual connectivity with many of the receivers inside BIRNM and a large number of core use receivers (mean: 10.7, range 6-14) within individual networks.ConclusionsMost C. latus were present in BIRNM at least twice per day, but were overall detected below the expected rates, demonstrating mobility, large core activity spaces and wide use of the acoustic array inside BIRNM and greater St. Croix shelf. How residency is inferred from acoustic telemetry detections, and interpreted for species with variable mobility, has important considerations for spatial management planning and telemetry analyses. For MPA development to meet the spatial requirements of species with mixed resident-mobile spatial ecology, detailed long-term movement data are required. Assessing residency in MPAs using acoustic telemetry should be formalized and carefully interpreted based on specific species, environmental conditions, and array configuration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Reef-associated",10.1186/s40317-020-00199-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Acoustic telemetry;Carangidae;Marine protected area;Movement patterns;Residency;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;CONTRASTING MOVEMENTS;CORAL-REEFS;HABITAT USE;RED HIND;FISHERIES,,

The study incorporated an array of 22 acoustic stations deployed within dense coral patches, seagrass meadows and mixed habitats of both seagrass and coral. Fifteen S. sutor carrying internal acoustic tags were monitored from November 2016 until May 2017. Detection patterns revealed them to be diurnal herbivores, with only rare nocturnal movements. Home-range estimates showed that individuals differed in their spatial range extents and habitats used, covering ~15% of the total shallow subtidal coastline of the island. However, they displayed very small daily movements (<200 m), concentrated mainly around sites within mixed coral and seagrass habitats. An optimal number of detections was recorded when the coral to seagrass area ratio was approximately 1.6:1. This ratio was confirmed through statistical prediction modelling.

Results from the fine-scale positioning system reinforced spatial and temporal partitioning in core use areas between individuals, indicating territorial behaviors, and showed evidence for both resident and transient movements. Preliminary fine-scale analysis also suggested diel variation in location of activity spaces.

We examined activity levels and behavioral patterns of red snapper over natural reefs, oil platforms and submerged ships. Telemetry tags (Sonotronics model Am) that transmitted tri-axial acceleration range, with average depth or average temperature were developed specifically to monitor red snapper and tested in captive fish. Wild red snapper were surgically implanted at depth and monitored for 16 months over artificial and natural reefs. Overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) as the sum of x, y and z acceleration range (0-0.398 g along each axis) was used to estimate activity levels of red snapper at each reef. Measurements of red snapper indicated that season, diel period, temperature time blocks and reef type had significant effects on ODBA and depth use. Red snapper were more active during the summer, at night, and during a period of rapid temperature increase. Red snapper were also generally more active and stayed at shallower depths on ships. The increases in activity reported here may be attributed to differing feeding or spawning behaviors on certain reefs. These results suggest that environmental factors such as temperature and diel period heavily influence red snapper and that they behave differently on specific habitat types at certain times. Future efforts to examine the ecological performance of red snapper across reef types should therefore carefully take environmental influences into account.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Artificial reefs",10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151202     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Artificial reef;Red snapper;Accelerometer;Acoustic telemetry;Gulf of Mexico;GULF-OF-MEXICO;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;FISH;ACCELERATION;MANAGEMENT;HABITAT;PERFORMANCE;MORTALITY;RESIDENCE,,

Acoustic telemetry demonstrated a bimodal pattern of entry to and departure from the main embayment via only one of several pathways. Among years, 33%-56% of fish occurred in the pathway prior to the closure, but most left before it ceased. Fish were detected within the closure in multiple but not always consecutive years. Variation in migration timing and aggregation philopatry may alter capture risk, but pre- and postspawning migratory fish are fished in the main pathway and adjacent reefs, which would presumably impact spawning aggregation biomass.

To better understand spatial and temporal movement patterns and help determine the effectiveness of a no-take marine reserve (Buck Island Reef National Monument, BIRNM), 55 queen triggerfish were surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters and tracked for 434.6 +/- 27.3 d (mean SE) within a large acoustic array in St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Queen triggerfish displayed high site fidelity within the reserve during non-spawning months. Home range sizes, as measured by 95 % minimum convex polygons and kernel utilization distributions, averaged 2.44 t 0.30 and 3.34 +/- 0.17 km(2), respectively. High site fidelity was interrupted briefly during full moons from November to March (2015-2017), when 22 % of the tagged population (n = 12) undertook repeated migrations to a nesting area located approximately 12 km from BIRNM. During the same-season spawning periods, 5 other fish were exclusively detected at a receiver station within the reserve, indicating a possible local nesting area and resident (non-migratory) contingent of queen triggerfish. The high site fidelity of queen triggerfish during non-spawning months coupled with the discovery of a resident spawning population highlights the importance of BIRNM as a potential refuge from local fishing pressures. This study provides improved understanding of queen triggerfish movement ecology, an extremely valuable asset for the development of spatial management strategies throughout their range.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  89 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning,Reef-associated",10.3354/meps12944     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Movement ecology;Marine reserves;Partial migration;Fisheries management;Acoustic telemetry;Balistidae;Spawning aggregation;CORAL-REEF FISH;SETTING CATCH LIMITS;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;MARINE RESERVES;NASSAU GROUPER;EPINEPHELUS-GUTTATUS;FISHERIES MANAGEMENT;HABITAT USE;RED HIND,,

Space use is a fundamental component of an animal's ecology, and the extent of an animal's home range has consequences for individual distributions, community structure and ecosystem function. As ocean temperatures continue to rise as a result of global warming, determining the effects of temperature on space use and movement patterns of important fisheries species is vital. Our aim was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in space use by a tropical fisheries species, the leopard coralgrouper (Plectropomus leopardus), from two latitudinally distinct locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to determine the potential response of large-bodied tropical fishes to ocean warming through behavioural modification. Using passive acoustic telemetry of 36 tagged individuals, we found that both core use areas (50%KUD) and home range extent (95%KUD) varied with respect to location, season, body size and temperature. Average home range extent (95%KUD) for tagged P. leopardus was 0.32 km(2) at the high-latitude location (Heron Island) compared to 0.23 km(2) at the low-latitude location (Opal Reef). However, core use areas (50%KUD) did not differ significantly between the two locations. Seasonal differences were also apparent at both locations with P. leopardusshowing contraction in home range extent during the summertime. This effect was most pronounced at the low-latitude location where home range was significantly reduced during summer when temperatures exceeded 27 degrees C. Taken together, our findings indicate that higher ambient temperature may elicit a sustained and significant decline in space use by a commercially important reef fish. Given projected increases in ocean temperature due to global climate change, large-bodied reef fishes may be increasingly constrained in their movement and space use, which will have ramifications for individual fitness, population viability, fisheries productivity and ecological function.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  74 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1111/1365-2435.13271     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;global warming;Great Barrier Reef;home range;increasing temperature;movement patterns;Plectropomus leopardus;GREAT-BARRIER-REEF;CORAL TROUT;HOME-RANGE;CLIMATE-CHANGE;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;HABITAT USE;MOVEMENT;SERRANIDAE;FISHERIES,,

The rivulated rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus was introduced from the Red Sea into the Mediterranean, where it is now found in extremely high abundances, and has overgrazed the coastal marine ecosystem in many locations. Through a continuous acoustic tracking system, we found that the movement of S. rivulatus individuals at a Mediterranean site differed substantially from those at a Red Sea site, with individuals in the Mediterranean having larger overall home ranges and lower site fidelity. However, no variation between sites was found in daily home range sizes. Results show that at the Mediterranean site S. rivulatus individuals have a larger spatial footprint, which may contribute to their impact and ability to expand their distribution. This study demonstrates a potential shift in individual movement of a marine invasive species between its native and invaded range, and highlights the role of movement in understanding biological invasions.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  27     Total Times Cited:  30     Cited Reference Count:  102 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Reef-associated,Herbivorous fish,Invasive or Exotic species",10.1007/s10530-018-1790-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Invasive species;Habitat utilization;Movement;Reef fish;Mediterranean Sea;Red Sea;TROPICAL REEF FISH;HOME-RANGE;TERRITORIAL DAMSELFISHES;PREDATION RISK;NORTHERN GULF;SITE FIDELITY;RED-SEA;MARINE;ECOLOGY;COMPETITION,,

Seventeen individuals were studied, and nighttime home range sizes that were calculated by 50 and 95% kernel utilization distributions were 5.9-fold and 5.5-fold greater, respectively, than the daytime home ranges. The average inter-center distance between home ranges during the 2 time periods ranged from 3.0 to 67.9 m (22.5 m on average), suggesting that the day-night home range shift within the home ground varied individually. Returning ability for 10 individuals that showed clear spawning migration behavior was also analyzed, and the average inter-center distance between home ranges during the periods before and after spawning was 8.1 m. Eight out of these 10 individuals showed precise returning after the spawning migration to the patchy coral substrates that were used before the spawning migration. The present study suggests that appropriate setting position of the home ground can establish long-term protection of the species due to their precise returning ability after the spawning migration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning | USER-NOTES: {""Bruna""=>[""Uso do habitat ?""]}",10.3354/meps12779     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Marine protected area;Home range size;Returning ability;Spawning migration;White-streaked grouper;WHITE-STREAKED GROUPER;SITE FIDELITY;HABITAT USE;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;AGGREGATIONS;BEHAVIOR;PARROTFISH;SERRANIDAE;RESERVES;FISH,,

We assessed ecosystem and trophic connectivity of two common reef fishes (schoolmaster, Lut-janus apodus; white grunt, Haemulon plumierii) and one predator (great barracuda, Sphyraena barracuda) in a Caribbean MSP ecosystem using acoustic telemetry and natural dietary tracers. Triangulated positions from an acoustic positioning system indicated that L. apodus and H. plumierii relied on multiple habitats within this MSP ecosystem, occupying areas with more cover (lower risk) during the day and areas with less cover (higher risk) at night. During the day, both species exhibited limited movement away from structured habitats (e.g., mangroves, patch reef) and avoided the primary activity space of S. barracuda in the central channel over sand bottom or seagrass. At night, L. apodus moved into the channel and adjacent seagrass beds on the margin of this high-risk area when S. barracuda occurrence was reduced, suggesting that this species adjusts its foraging activities to minimize encounter rates with predators. Haemulon plumierii also displayed distinct day-night shifts with directed movements at twilight across higher risk habitat to nighttime locations in seagrass. Conspicuous changes in the rate of movement were also detected at different times of the day, and observed mismatches between movement rates of S. barracuda and our two potential prey species appeared to be a behavioral response to reduce their vulnerability. Dietary tracer analysis supported the premise that observed shifts to nocturnal habitats were associated with foraging, with significant contributions of organic matter derived from nighttime locations. Findings from this study clearly demonstrate that the configuration of habitats and spatiotemporal variability in predation risk are key determinants of movement and foraging activities for these species, indicating that an improved understanding of seascape connectivity is critical to the management of reef-dependent species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  33     Total Times Cited:  36     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mixed habitats",10.1002/ecs2.2200     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;coral reef;foraging;habitat connectivity;migration;nursery habitat;stable isotopes;CORAL-REEF;SEAGRASS BEDS;HAEMULON-FLAVOLINEATUM;HABITAT USE;ANTIPREDATOR BEHAVIOR;CARIBBEAN MANGROVES;GRUNTS HAEMULIDAE;PUERTO-RICO;TRADE-OFF;FOOD-WEB,,

Many of these animals, however, are impossible to observe directly, making it necessary to use indirect methods of observation such as biotelemetry in order to study them. Despite technological advances with tracking equipment enabling movement to be assessed in 3 dimensions, many studies restrict their analyses to traditional 2-dimensional (2D) space use. We compared 2D and 3D (1) core and home range size, (2) home range overlap and (3) changes in space use in relation to biological and environmental variables of a large, demersal reef-dwelling fish species, the eastern blue groper Achoerodus viridis, tracked using passive acoustic telemetry. Mixed effects models were used to determine differences between the core/home range sizes and home range overlap between the sex of the fish and the breeding and non-breeding seasons. The 2D analyses were unable to detect differences in core and home range sizes between the sexes that were successfully identified by the 3D analyses. 2D analyses only detected differences in home range overlap between the breeding and non-breeding seasons, whereas the 3D analyses found seasonal differences according to the sex of the fish. Two-hourly 2D space use estimates failed to detect differences in space use between fished and protected areas that were detected in the 3D analyses. This study demonstrates that to truly understand how animals use the space they inhabit, we must assess their movement in the full spatial context of their environment.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  88 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3354/meps12097     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Utilization distribution;Passive acoustic telemetry;Home range;Territoriality;Labridae;Achoerodus viridis;Eastern blue groper;IMOS-AT;HOME-RANGE SIZE;UTILIZATION DISTRIBUTIONS;REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY;ACOUSTIC TRACKING;MOVEMENT;BIOTELEMETRY;PATTERNS;LABRIDAE;BEHAVIOR;OVERLAP,,

In Efate Island (Vanuatu), 38 thumbprint emperors Lethrinus harak (Lethrinidae) were tagged at 7 sites and tracked between April 2011 and February 2012 using an acoustic array of 16 receivers. The survey area extended over 11.3 km(2) of fringing reef in 3 coastal community tenures that included 3 small CFRs. Habitats were mapped using very high resolution satellite imagery and ground-truthing. Thirty fish were detected for up to 229 d (median = 153 d). Six geographical groups were identified among 21 resident fish. These groups showed strong fidelity to small sites (116 to 763 m) that were located in reserves and fished areas, across community tenures, and across 12 habitat types. Overall, 42 excursions were detected at several hundreds to thousands of meters from the fidelity sites along contiguous fringing reefs, across habitat types, and across boundaries of CFRs and community tenures. The estimated home range size of L. harak ranged from 116 to 3979 m (median: 763 m) and was highly varied within fish groups. We concluded that home range size and behavioral plasticity of L. harak limit the effectiveness of small individual CFRs for protecting this species. Networks of CFRs would be more effective but require management arrangements between neighbor communities.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  4     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Mixed techniques",10.3354/meps12113     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Acoustic telemetry;Fish movement;Community-managed area;Fishery reserve;Lethrinus harak;Vanuatu;Coral reef;MARINE PROTECTED AREA;PLECTROPOMUS LEOPARDUS SERRANIDAE;SITE FIDELITY;HOME-RANGE;SPAWNING MIGRATION;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;RYUKYU ISLANDS;REEF FISHES;HABITAT;DESIGN,,

We used a multi-pronged, interdisciplinary approach to test if higher biomass of herbivorous fishes inside a no-take marine reserve makes this area more resistant to invasive algal overgrowth. Over a two year time period, we (1) compared fish biomass and algal cover between two fished and one unfished patch reef in Hawai'i, (2) used acoustic telemetry to determine fidelity of herbivorous fishes to the unfished reef, and (3) used metabarcoding and next-generation sequencing to determine diet composition of herbivorous fishes. Herbivore fish biomass was significantly higher in the marine reserve compared to adjacent fished reefs, whereas invasive algal cover differed by species. Herbivorous fish movements were largely confined to the unfished patch reef where they were captured. Diet analysis indicated that the consumption of invasive algae varied among fish species, with a high prevalence of comparatively rare native algal species. Together these findings demonstrate that the contribution of herbivores to coral reef resilience, via resistance to invasive algae invasion, is complex and species-specific.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  19     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  74 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1038/srep43819     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PHASE-SHIFTS;BLUESPINE UNICORNFISH;HABITAT UTILIZATION;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;PROTECTED AREAS;NASO-UNICORNIS;KANEOHE BAY;HERBIVORY;RESILIENCE;SIZE,,

Nineteen K. bigibbus captured near adjacent but distinct patch reefs were tagged with internal acoustic tags and their movements monitored for up to 20 months by an array of 60 acoustic receivers. Home-range estimates showed that movements of individuals from each patch reef encompassed different spatial extents and resulted in differences in habitat used by the two groups of fish. The average 50 and 95% kernel utilisation distribution for long-term resident fish was 0.27 +/- 0.03 and 1.61 +/- 0.30 km(2) respectively, ranges that represent the largest values for a herbivorous coral reef fish recorded to date. There was a significantly higher degree of fidelity among fish from the same school, and to particular patch reefs, despite the proximity of the reefs and substantial overlap between schools of conspecifics. A coefficient of sociality was used on pairs of fish and showed that there was no evidence that individuals were consistently detected together when they were detected by receivers away from their home reef. The variability of movement patterns among individuals of K. bigibbus results in an increased niche footprint for this important browser, potentially increasing reef resilience.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  20     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Herbivorous fish",10.1071/MF16199     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;algae;coral reef;herbivorous fish;marine protected area;movement;Ningaloo Reef;TURTLES CHELONIA-MYDAS;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;CORAL-REEFS;DIEL ACTIVITY;PARROTFISHES;ECOLOGY;SIZE;L.,,

Clearly differentiated diel and tidal habitat use patterns were evident in significant proportions of individuals, particularly in relation to tidal phase. For the majority of residents, home-range sizes were reasonably stable over periods of 2-4 years, but in some cases core areas did shift over time. At seasonal time scales, peaks of seasonal activity and home range area were recorded during spawning season (October-December). Long-distance return migrations to spawning locations were observed that were among the longest observed for any reef fish (over 130km). Suspected spawning-related movements were recorded almost exclusively in fish >500-mm fork length, and were semilunar, following quarter moons in October-December.

Received sound pressure levels from pile strikes on the interior of the wharf, where reef fish primarily occur, were on average 152 -157 dB re 1 mu Pa (peak). No significant decrease in sheepshead daytime residency was observed during pile driving within the central portion of the wharf and area of highest sound exposure, and no major indicators of displacement from the exposure wharf with the onset of pile driving were observed. There was evidence of potential displacement from the exposure wharf that coincided with the start of pile driving observed for 2 out of 4 grey snapper, along with a decrease in daytime residency for a subset of this species with high site fidelity prior to the event.

Mortality on coral reefs is intrinsically linked with predation, with most evidence suggesting that predation is highest during crepuscular periods. We tested this hypothesis using passive acoustic telemetry data to determine the time of day of potential mortality events (PMEs) of adult herbivorous reef fishes. A total of 94 fishes were tagged with acoustic transmitters, of which 43 exhibited a PME. Furthermore, we identified five categories of PMEs based on the nature of change in acoustic signal detections from tagged fishes. The majority of PMEs were characterised by an abrupt stop in detections, possibly as a result of a large, mobile predator. Overall, mortality rates were estimated to be approximately 59 % per year using passive acoustic telemetry. The time of day of PMEs suggests that predation was highest during the day and crepuscular periods and lowest at night, offering only partial support for the crepuscular predation hypothesis. Visually oriented, diurnal and crepuscular predators appear to be more important than their nocturnal counterparts in terms of predation on adult reef fishes.

Grazing by tropical herbivores contributes to maintaining resilient coral reefs and marine reserves are critical in conserving herbivores and the functional role they provide. Less is known, however, about the effects of marine reserves on herbivorous fish and their role on temperate reefs. This study evaluated the potential for marine reserves to enhance grazing by herbivores on temperate reefs in Jervis Bay Marine Park, Australia. First, the movement patterns of a dominant grazer, luderick Girella tricuspidata, were determined using acoustic telemetry to assess the potential effects of marine reserves on G. tricuspidata. Second, the size and abundance of G. tricuspidata and other grazers (rock blackfish Girella elevata and silver drummer Kyphosus sydneyanus) was quantified on shallow subtidal reefs inside and outside marine reserves using a diver operated stereo-video system. Finally, grazing rates were quantified inside and outside marine reserves using video cameras. Luderick G. tricuspidata exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs and was significantly larger and more abundant within marine reserves. Rock blackfish G. elevata was significantly more abundant in one of four marine reserves, although showed no difference in size between zones. Silver drummer K. sydneyanus was significantly larger in marine reserves, although not significantly more abundant. On shallow subtidal reefs, G. tricuspidata was the dominant grazer compared to other girellids and kyphosids, accounting for >97% of total algal bites (predominantly on algal turfs). Grazing rates were higher on average within marine reserves (although not significantly higher) and there was a positive correlation between the relative abundance of G. tricuspidata and number of algal bites, indicating grazing intensity increased with abundance. The findings in this study demonstrate the clear potential for greater grazing by herbivores within temperate marine reserves. This study also suggests that exploitation of targeted herbivores on temperate reefs is significant and marine reserves can reduce this impact and allow it to be measured via reference areas.

Our results indicate that the observed behavioural plasticity in the marine protected area could be the result of multiple ecological and environmental drivers such as size, sex and increased intra-specific competition. Our findings support the view that habitat diversity helps support high densities of fishes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sixty adult Lethrinus miniatus were acoustically tagged and monitored along a coral reef slope for up to 1 yr. Individuals occurred more often on the reef slope during days of cooler temperatures, suggesting a thermal tolerance threshold may exist. Results indicate that individuals responded to elevated temperatures by moving away from the reef slope to deeper adjacent habitats, thus shifting their position in the water column to remain at a preferred temperature. Space use within the water column (vertical activity space) was not influenced by environmental parameters or fish size, but this result was possibly influenced by use of deeper habitat outside the acoustic array that was not monitored. With elevation of ocean temperature, L. miniatus may need to adapt to warmer waters or disperse into cooler habitats, by either shifting their distribution deeper or towards higher latitudes.

The study focused on C. auratus movements around Cabbage Tree Island, which is predominantly a no-take sanctuary zone (no fishing), with an array of acoustic stations deployed around the island and adjacent reefs and islands. Thirty C. auratus were tagged with internal acoustic tags in November 2010 with their movements recorded until September 2014. Both adult and juvenile C. auratus were observed to display strong site fidelity to Cabbage Tree Island with a mean 12-month residency index of 0.83 (range = 0 low to 1 high). Only three fish were detected on acoustic receivers away from Cabbage Tree Island, with one fish moving a considerable distance of similar to 290 kms over a short time frame (46 days). The longest period of residency recorded at the island was for three fish occurring regularly at the site for a period of 1249 days. Chrysophrys auratus displayed strong diurnal behaviour and detection frequency was significantly higher during the day than at night; however, there was no significant difference in detection frequency between different hours.

The spatial and temporal dimensions of fish behavior (movement and/or vertical migrations) are particularly relevant for rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) because most rockfish species are long-lived and have high site fidelity, increasing their vulnerability to overexploitation. In this study, we describe the short-term (with a tracking period of up to 46 d) spatial behavior, as determined by acoustic tracking, of the black rockfish Sebastes schlegelii, a species subject to overexploitation in the Yellow Sea of China. The average residence index (the ratio of detected days to the total period from release to the last detection) in the study area was 0.92 +/- 0.13, and most of the tagged fish were detected by only one region of the acoustic receiver array, suggesting relatively high site fidelity to the study area. Acoustic tracking also suggested that this species is more frequently detected during the day than at night in our study area. However, the diel detection periodicity (24 h) was only evident for certain periods of the tracking time, as revealed by a continuous wavelet transform. The habitat selection index of tagged S. schlegelii suggested that S. schlegelii preferred natural reefs, mixed sand/artificial reef bottoms and mixed bottoms of boulder, cobble, gravel and artificial reefs. The preference of this species for the artificial reefs that were recently deployed in the study area suggests that artificial seascapes may be effective management tools to attract individuals. The vertical movement of tagged S. schlegelii was mostly characterized by bottom dwelling behavior, and there was high individual variability in the vertical migration pattern. Our results have important implications for S. schlegelii catchability, the implementation of marine protected areas, and the identification of key species habitats, and our study provides novel information for future studies on the sustainability of this important marine resource in eastern China.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  132     Total Times Cited:  138     Cited Reference Count:  100 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0134381     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HOME-RANGE SIZE;ARTIFICIAL REEFS;SITE FIDELITY;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;STOCK ENHANCEMENT;FISH ASSEMBLAGE;MARINE RESERVE;DIEL BEHAVIOR;ROCKY REEF;DESIGN,,

We investigated the spatial overlap between the two species and compared intra-specific spatial overlap between day and night. Presence-absence models showed different diel presence and habitat use patterns between the two species. We constructed a spatial network of the movement patterns, which showed that for both species when fish were detected by the array of receivers most movements were made around the coral reef habitat while occasionally moving to silt habitats. Our results show that most individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations and habitat types, although individual behavioral changes were observed for some individuals across time. Our study also highlights the necessity to consider multiple species during MPA implementation and to take into account the specific biological and ecological traits of each species. The low number of fish detected within the receiver array, as well as the intraspecific variability observed in this study, highlight the need to compare results across species and individuals to be used for MPA management.

Results showed increased horizontal movements and higher activity in deeper water during the day in the austral summer. Movement patterns, both vertically and horizontally, appeared to be influenced by water temperature, but also corresponded with spawning season.

Twenty-four G. elevata individuals were internally tagged with pressure-sensing acoustic transmitters across these two arrays and monitored for up to 550 days. An existing network of coastal receivers was used to examine large-scale movement patterns. Individuals exhibited varying residency, but all had small activity-space sizes within the arrays. The species utilised shallow rocky-reef habitat, displaying unimodal or bimodal patterns in depth use. A positive correlation was observed between wind speed and the detection depth of fish, with fish being likely to move to deeper water to escape periods of adverse conditions. Detection frequency data, corrected using sentinel tags, generally illustrated diurnal behaviour. Patterns of habitat usage, residency and spatial utilisation highlighted the susceptibility of G. elevata to recreational fishing pressure. The results from the present study will further contribute to the spatial information required in the zoning of effective marine protected areas, and our understanding of temperate reef fish ecology.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  69 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1071/MF14182     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Girella elevata;home range;marine protected areas;movement;residency;residency index;sentinel transmitters;NEW-SOUTH-WALES;HOME-RANGE;WAVE ENERGY;SURGICAL IMPLANTATION;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;FISH ASSEMBLAGES;EAST-COAST;CORAL;TRANSMITTERS;PERFORMANCE,,

To determine the value of the humphead wrasse as an umbrella species for coral reef conservation, we conducted a multi-year study of humphead wrasse home range at Palmyra Atoll, Central Tropical Pacific, tagging juvenile, female, and male individuals with acoustic transmitters. We quantified home range using 2 metrics, length and area, and determined if these metrics were related to the sex and maturity status of the individual. We recorded individual movements during 5030 fish days, yielding detailed records for 14 individuals comprising 3 juveniles, 5 females, and 6 males. The home range of humphead wrasse measured over a 2 yr study was 0.4 to 14 km and changed with ontogeny. Females had larger home ranges than other reef fishes studied to date (n = 68), indicating value as an umbrella species for coral reefs. We compared the home range of the species to the size distribution of tropical marine protected areas (MPAs), and used a model to estimate the MPA length necessary to retain humphead wrasse.

To better understand Spangled Emperor movements and the adequacy of sanctuary zones within the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park for this species, 84 Spangled Emperor of a broad spectrum of maturity and sex were tagged using internal acoustic tags in a range of lagoon and reef slope habitats both inside and adjacent to the Mangrove Bay Sanctuary zone. Kernel Utilisation Distribution (KUD) was calculated for 39 resident individuals that were detected for more than 30 days. There was no relationship with fish size and movement or site fidelity. Average home range (95% KUD) for residents was 8.5 +/- 0.5 km(2) compared to average sanctuary zone size of 30 km(2). Calculated home range was stable over time resulting in resident animals tagged inside the sanctuary zone spending similar to 80% of time within the sanctuary boundaries. The number of fish remaining within the array of receivers declined steadily over time and after one year more than 60% of tagged fish had moved outside the sanctuary zone and also beyond the 28 km(2) array of receivers. Long term monitoring identified the importance of shifting home range and was essential for understanding overall residency within protected areas and also for identifying spawning related movements.

Those species responsible for maintaining functional connectivity between habitats are often called mobile links and are regarded as essential elements of resilience. By providing connectivity, they support resilience across spatial scales. Most marine organisms, including fishes, have long-term, biogeographic-scale connectivity through larval movement. Although most reef species are highly site attached after larval settlement, some taxa may also be able to provide rapid, reef-scale connectivity as adults. On coral reefs, the identity of such taxa and the extent of their mobility are not yet known. We use acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of Kyphosus vaigiensis, one of the few reef fishes that feeds on adult brown macroalgae. Unlike other benthic herbivorous fish species, it also exhibits large-scale (> 2 km) movements. Individual K. vaigiensis cover, on average, a 2.5 km length of reef (11 km maximum) each day. These large-scale movements suggest that this species may act as a mobile link, providing functional connectivity, should the need arise, and helping to support functional processes across habitats and spatial scales. An analysis of published studies of home ranges in reef fishes found a consistent relationship between home range size and body length. K. vaigiensis is the sole herbivore to depart significantly from the expected home range-body size relationship, with home range sizes more comparable to exceptionally mobile large pelagic predators rather than other reef herbivores. While the large-scale movements of K. vaigiensis reveal its potential capacity to enhance resilience over large areas, it also emphasizes the potential limitations of small marine reserves to protect some herbivore populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  37     Total Times Cited:  37     Cited Reference Count:  66 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00338-014-1124-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Home range;Ecosystem function;Coral reefs;Functional connectivity;Kyphosus vaigiensis;Cross-scale interactions;HOME-RANGE SIZE;BLUESPINE UNICORNFISH;ALGAL SUCCESSION;SPATIAL ECOLOGY;NASO-UNICORNIS;PHASE-SHIFTS;RESILIENCE;CONNECTIVITY;PARROTFISH;DISPERSAL,,

Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support.        On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well understood.        Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community.        Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an 'ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef.        Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using network graph theory to analyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  29     Total Times Cited:  33     Cited Reference Count:  79 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1111/1365-2435.12190     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),small-world networks;acoustic telemetry;coral reef resilience;spatial ecology;parrotfishes;roving herbivores;ecosystem function;rabbitfishes;MARINE RESERVE;FOOD WEBS;ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;FISH COMMUNITIES;SPATIAL NETWORK;CLIMATE-CHANGE;PHASE-SHIFTS;RESILIENCE;ECOSYSTEMS,,

Some individuals showed a few long periods of undetection of 1-2 months in the Formigas reserve, mostly in the fall and winter. Mobility within this seamount increased during spring and summer, and geostrophic current speed was negatively correlated with detection probability. Overall, the acoustic telemetry results showed that adult almaco jacks were resident year-round, refuting the traditional view that these fish are essentially migratory and a seasonal occurrence in the Azores.

The performance of no-take MPAs (i.e., marine reserves) for protecting and rebuilding fish populations is influenced by the movement of animals within and across their boundaries. Very little is known about Caribbean reef fish movements creating a critical knowledge gap that can impede effective MPA design, performance and evaluation. Using miniature implanted acoustic transmitters and a fixed acoustic receiver array, we address three key questions: How far can reef fish move? Does connectivity exist between adjacent MPAs? Does existing MPA size match the spatial scale of reef fish movements? We show that many reef fishes are capable of traveling far greater distances and in shorter duration than was previously known. Across the Puerto Rican Shelf, more than half of our 163 tagged fish (18 species of 10 families) moved distances greater than 1 km with three fish moving more than 10 km in a single day and a quarter spending time outside of MPAs. We provide direct evidence of ecological connectivity across a network of MPAs, including estimated movements of more than 40 km connecting a nearshore MPA with a shelf-edge spawning aggregation. Most tagged fish showed high fidelity to MPAs, but also spent time outside MPAs, potentially contributing to spillover. Three-quarters of our fish were capable of traveling distances that would take them beyond the protection offered by at least 40-64% of the existing eastern Caribbean MPAs. We recommend that key species movement patterns be used to inform and evaluate MPA functionality and design, particularly size and shape. A re-scaling of our perception of Caribbean reef fish mobility and habitat use is imperative, with important implications for ecology and management effectiveness.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  84     Total Times Cited:  88     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1371/journal.pone.0096028     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),REGION-WIDE DECLINES;CORAL-REEFS;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;RESERVE NETWORKS;RED HIND;PATTERNS;CONSERVATION;PERSPECTIVE;ANIMALS;SCIENCE,,

Shelf-wide migrations of this stock are well documented, but movements and home ranges of fish during their inshore residency period have not been described. We tagged 122 Black Sea Bass with acoustic transmitters at a mid-Atlantic reef to estimate home-range size and factors that influence movements (>400 m) at a 46.1-km(2) study site between May and November 2003. Activity of Black Sea Bass was greatest and most consistent during summer but declined rapidly in September as water temperatures at the bottom of the seafloor increased on the inner shelf. Black Sea Bass maintained relatively large home ranges that were fish-size invariant but highly variable (13.7-736.4 ha), underscoring the importance of large sample sizes in examination of population-level characteristics of mobile species with complex social interactions. On the basis of observed variations in movement patterns and the size of home ranges, we postulate the existence of groups of conspecifics that exhibit similar space-use behaviors. The group of males released earlier in the tagging period used larger home ranges than the group of males released later in our study. In addition, mean activity levels and the probability of movement among acoustic stations varied among groups of fish in a complex manner that depended on sex. These differences in movement behaviors may increase the vulnerability of male fish to passive fishing gears, further exacerbating variation in exploitation rates for this species among reefs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  23     Cited Reference Count:  54 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.7755/FB.112.1.6     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HABITAT USE;SITE FIDELITY;PATTERNS;BEHAVIOR;SPACE;TOOL,,

However, the comparison between the behavior of wild fish inhabiting either natural or artificial habitats has received less attention. Thus the spatio-temporal patterns of fish that establish their home range in one habitat or the other and their consequences of intra-population differentiation on life-history remain largely unexplored. We hypothesize that individuals with a preferred habitat (i.e. natural vs. artificial) can behave differently in terms of habitat use, with important consequences on population dynamics (e. g. life-history, mortality, and reproductive success). Therefore, using biotelemetry, 98 white seabream (Diplodus sargus) inhabiting either artificial or natural habitats were tagged and their behavior was monitored for up to eight months. Most white seabreams were highly resident either on natural or artificial reefs, with a preference for the shallow artificial reef subsets. Connectivity between artificial and natural reefs was limited for resident individuals due to great inter-habitat distances. The temporal behavioral patterns of white seabreams differed between artificial and natural reefs. Artificial-reef resident fish had a predominantly nocturnal diel pattern, whereas natural-reef resident fish showed a diurnal diel pattern. Differences in diel behavioral patterns of white seabream inhabiting artificial and natural reefs could be the expression of realized individual specialization resulting from differences in habitat configuration and resource availability between these two habitats. Artificial reefs have the potential to modify not only seascape connectivity but also the individual behavioral patterns of fishes. Future management plans of coastal areas and fisheries resources, including artificial reef implementation, should therefore consider the potential effect of habitat modification on fish behavior, which could have key implications on fish dynamics.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  41     Total Times Cited:  47     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Artificial reefs | USER-NOTES: {""Bruna""=>[""Telemetria acústica???""]}",10.1371/journal.pone.0069303     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),WHITE SEA BREAM;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;DIPLODUS-SARGUS;REEF FISH;HOME-RANGE;REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY;HABITAT UTILIZATION;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;MARINE RESERVES;DIEL ACTIVITY,,

We surgically implanted fourteen fish with acoustic transmitters and actively and passively tracked individuals to determine fine and broad scale movement patterns respectively. Eight fish were actively tracked for 24 h d(1) for 6 d (May 2011), and then intermittently over the following 30 d. Six fish were passively tracked from December 2011 to March 2012, using a fixed array of receivers deployed across rocky reefs around the perimeter of the bay. Luderick exhibited strong site fidelity on shallow subtidal reefs, tending to remain on or return consistently to the reef where they were caught and released. All eight fish actively tracked used core areas solely on their release reef, with the exception of one fish that used multiple core areas, and four of the six fish passively tracked spent between 75 to 96% of days on release reefs over the entire tracking period. Luderick did move frequently to adjacent reefs, and occasionally to more distant reefs, however consistently returned to their release reef. Luderick also exhibited predictable patterns in movement between spatially distinct daytime and night-time core use areas. Night-time core use areas were generally located in sheltered areas behind the edge of reefs.

Often found in schools, Scarus rivulatus, is an abundant herbivorous species on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, especially on inshore reefs. Recent evidence has highlighted the limited spatial movements of some herbivorous fishes. However, individuals in schools are thought to be much more mobile. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the spatial range of schooling S. rivulatus to measure the spatial scale over which they exert their functional role. Furthermore, we assess the influence of the schooling behaviour on their feeding rates and thus their ecological impact. The diurnal movements of S. rivulatus were monitored using acoustic transmitters and a passive acoustic array for up to 7 months in Pioneer Bay, Orpheus Island, GBR. In addition, behavioural observations recorded school size-frequency distributions and feeding rates of S. rivulatus inside and outside foraging schools. Despite schooling, all S. rivulatus were site attached. On average, the maximum potential home range of individuals was 24,440 m(2) and ranges overlapped extensively in individuals captured from the same school. School size was highly variable, with a mean school size of 5.7 individuals. Schooling had a significant impact on the functional role of individuals, with feeding rates in schools being two times higher for S. rivulatus and over three times higher for other scarid species. Our results suggest that, despite schooling, individual S. rivulatus only rove over a limited area of reef (occupying a linear stretch of reef, measuring only approximately 250 m for individuals and 220 m for entire schools). Each individual may therefore have little impact on the spatial resilience of coral reefs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  49     Total Times Cited:  60     Cited Reference Count:  62 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00338-012-0922-z     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Home range;Ecosystem function;Coral reefs;Spatial resilience;Schooling;Herbivory;CORAL-REEF FISH;PHASE-SHIFTS;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;RESILIENCE;PARROTFISH;PATTERNS;DIVERSITY;DYNAMICS;SIZE;DEGRADATION,,

Movements of an important recreational target species from the Mediterranean Sea, the parrotfish Sparisoma cretense. were determined in a marine protected area using passive acoustic telemetry, to evaluate site fidelity and homing, quantify home range and identify temporal patterns. Six adult parrotfish (20.8-29.8 cm total length) were caught along the north-eastern coast of Lampedusa (Italy) and surgically implanted with acoustic transmitters. Three fish were caught and released at the same site within the integral (i.e. ""no entry-no take"") reserve, whereas the others were caught outside the reserve boundary and released at the mid reserve 0.5 km apart. Two of the three fish that were released away from the capture site demonstrated homing abilities. Four fish showed a strong site fidelity, whereas the others moved frequently in and out of the monitoring area. Home range sizes estimated over the period of monitoring (up to 207 days) varied from 70,387 to 256,398 m(2), with core areas of 16,688 to 84,946 m(2). Home range size did not differ significantly between day and night. Home ranges of all fish extended beyond the reserve boundaries, showing example of potential spillover into take zones. Temporal activity patterns of fish were diurnal with a dominant diel rhythm, likely due to a resting behaviour at night.

The average diurnal home range of C. microrhinos was 7,830 m(2) +/- 940 (SE). Core areas of activity (50% kernel utilization distributions) were relatively small, encompassing approximately 22% of an individual's home range (1,690 m(2) +/- 220). Core areas exhibited greater topographic complexity. C. microrhinos may select these areas because of decreased predation risk. Feeding intensities were not homogenous throughout the home range. Core areas were found to have a greater number of feeding scars and are thus exposed to increased bioerosion and algal removal by C. microrhinos. While important in shaping key ecosystem processes, the ecosystem impact of individual C. microrhinos in Pioneer Bay appears to be restricted to small areas within a narrow band along the reef crest.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  92     Total Times Cited:  100     Cited Reference Count:  75 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00338-011-0813-8     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Home range;Ecosystem function;Coral reefs;Spatial resilience;Herbivory;Telemetry;HOME-RANGE SIZE;CORAL-REEF FISHES;HABITAT UTILIZATION;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;PHASE-SHIFTS;BLUESPINE UNICORNFISH;EPILITHIC ALGAL;FAMILY SCARIDAE;NASO-UNICORNIS;SITE FIDELITY,,

However, fine-scale movements and use of artificial reefs by red snapper over diel periods is unclear. Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550-745 mm TL; n = 12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100 m, with 75% of locations within 30 m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean = 27.5 m, SD = 7.1) than day (mean = 19.1 m, SD = 8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332-958d based on passive acoustic monitoring. The close proximity of these fish to the reef over 24-h periods and the long-term residency provides evidence that these artificial reefs are important habitat for red snapper and should be considered an effective management tool.

The direct benefit of this protection, the so called 'reserve effect', is the build-up of biomass through an increase in individual numbers and size. This effect can take several years depending on the life history traits of the target species. However, empirical studies on individual fish spatial behaviour at temporal scales long enough to be compatible with that of invoking the reserve effect are still virtually lacking. We studied the inter-annual patterns of habitat use of the dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus), an endangered reef fish predator, using passive acoustic telemetry inside and around a small marine reserve in the Azores, mid-north Atlantic. All 11 individuals resided in the reserve year-round for up to 5 years. During these periods, fish were detected nearly every day and utilised stable core activity areas. Two smaller fish apparently abandoned the area after some time, probably relocating outside the reserve. Our results indicate that even small marine reserves can promote the long-term recovery of some endangered species if the long-term behaviour (i.e. site fidelity) of individuals is appropriate. This result bears direct implications for most existing coastal marine reserves, given that they fall into the small size range and many overexploited reef fish species may be highly site attached.

In studies of an organism's functional ecology, key behavioural traits such as foraging periodicity are assumed to be uniform across the species. In particular, the fundamental division between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns is usually assumed to be a fixed one, with organisms demonstrating physiological traits optimised for a particular diel rhythm.        2. In this study, we explore the activity rhythm of a tropical reef fish, the golden-lined rabbitfish, Siganus lineatus. We make use of acoustic telemetry (manual tracking), combined with underwater observations of feeding behaviour to investigate the diel foraging patterns of S. lineatus, at three sites around the lagoon of Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef.        3. We found significant differences in the activity patterns of shoreline and reef-based populations of S. lineatus. Individuals inhabiting the boulder-shoreline site foraged during the day and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the two reef populations foraged only during nocturnal hours, remaining stationary at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish.        4. We suggest that S. lineatus is a diurnal nominal herbivore whose biological rhythm has developed the flexibility to be nocturnal. This development may simply represent the masking effects of predation, competition or ontogeny, or it may represent entrainment over an evolutionary time-scale necessary to enable the species to expand its range into the coral reef environment.        5. Either way, the results identify S. lineatus as a potential subject for research into the relative importance of the various biological forces driving divisions along the temporal niche axis and suggest that the species has the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at the ecological and evolutionary level.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  83     Total Times Cited:  92     Cited Reference Count:  84 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01874.x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),acoustic telemetry;adaptive foraging;biological rhythm;chronoecology;coral reef;facultative nocturnal herbivore;rabbitfish;temporal niche partitioning;HOME-RANGE SIZE;ACTIVITY PATTERNS;HABITAT UTILIZATION;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;BROWN TROUT;FORAGING PERIODICITY;FOOD AVAILABILITY;SWIMMING ACTIVITY;FEEDING-ACTIVITY;DIURNAL ACTIVITY,,

While a build-up of fish biomass has occurred inside reserve boundaries, it is unknown whether reserve size matches the scale of movement of target species. Using passive acoustic telemetry, we quantified movement patterns and home range size of two heavily exploited unicornfish Naso unicornis and Naso lituratus. Fifteen fish (N. unicornis: n = 7; N. lituratus: n = 4 male, n = 4 female) were fitted with internal acoustic tags and tracked continuously over four months within a remote acoustic receiver array located in a decade-old marine reserve. This approach provided robust estimates of unicornfish movement patterns and home range size. The mean home range of 3.2 ha for N. unicornis was almost ten times larger than that previously recorded from a three-week tracking study of the species in Hawaii. While N. lituratus were smaller in body size, their mean home range (6.8 ha) was over twice that of N. unicornis. Both species displayed strong site fidelity, particularly during nocturnal and crepuscular periods. Although there was some overlap, individual movement patterns and home range size were highly variable within species and between sexes. N. unicornis home range increased with body size, and only the three largest fish home ranges extended into the deeper outer reef slope beyond the shallow reef flat. Both Naso species favoured habitat dominated by corals. Some individuals made predictable daily crepuscular migrations between different locations or habitat types. There was no evidence of significant spillover from the marine reserve into adjacent fished areas. Strong site fidelity coupled with negligible spillover suggests that small-scale reserves, with natural habitat boundaries to emigration, are effective in protecting localized unicornfish populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  66     Total Times Cited:  79     Cited Reference Count:  58 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00338-011-0770-2     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Acoustic telemetry;Home range;Movement patterns;Marine reserves;Acanthuridae;Guam;TROUT PLECTROPOMUS LEOPARDUS;FISHERIES CONSERVATION ZONE;REMOTE HAWAIIAN ATOLLS;CORAL-REEF FISH;SITE FIDELITY;HABITAT UTILIZATION;BLUESPINE UNICORNFISH;SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT;PROTECTED AREAS;NASO-UNICORNIS,,

Range testing and visual observations revealed the limitations of using small acoustic transmitters to monitor movements of small coral reef fish in a topographically complex and noisy coral reef environment. Visual observations of conventionally tagged and albino fish suggest individuals return each day to forage over the same few hundred m(2) of shallow, turf algae dominated boulder and reef flat habitat for periods of at least weeks to months. Acoustic telemetry data suggest lower frequency of repeated use of daytime foraging, nighttime refuge and sunset spawning sites. However, integration of observation and acoustic telemetry data revealed that many fish were not detected while they were within the empirically tested range of the receivers. These observations indicate that data from passive acoustic telemetry can underestimate the frequency and duration of repeated use of specific areas. Yellow tang adults made daily crepuscular migrations of up to 600 m between foraging and spawning or sheltering sites at consistent times relative to sunset and sunrise. While there was high individual variability in migration distance, almost all individuals moved in the same direction (from south to north) at sunset.

Bluestriped grunts Haemulon sciurus and schoolmaster snapper Lutjanus apodus were tracked over 24 h periods using boat-based acoustic telemetry.

For both fish species, night activity spaces were significantly larger than day activity spaces. Fish exhibited a daytime preference for seascapes with aggregate coral reef and colonized bedrock, then shifted to night activity spaces with lower-complexity soft sediment including sand, seagrass, and scattered coral/rock. Movement path complexity was negatively correlated with seascape complexity. This demonstrates direct connectivity across multiple patch types and represents the first study to apply quantitative landscape ecology techniques to examine the movement ecology of marine fish.

If individuals inside reserves behave differently to those outside, this information should be incorporated into reserve design and in management efforts to avoid the selective removal of certain behaviors. We used acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of the sparid Pagrus auratus (snapper) inside and outside a marine reserve (the Leigh Marine Reserve, north-eastern New Zealand). We tagged 39 snapper within an array of acoustic receivers that encompassed reserve and fished areas. Nineteen snapper were resident over a 5-month period; the remainder either left the array or died. Residential fish expressed two home range types. One group had uni-modal home ranges that on average encompassed c.900 m linear distance. All nine residential snapper from the reserve displayed this behavior, as well as five of ten residential fish from the non-reserve area. The second group (five fish, all from the non-reserve area) had home ranges with two separate modes (bi-modal home ranges), which on average encompassed c.2 100 m linear distance. We suggest that some aspect of the marine reserve environment encourages extreme residency by either the modification of individual behaviors or through the removal of selective exploitation. If true this suggests that reserves and populations of exploited animals may become dependent on the life history characteristics of the individuals they encourage or select for.

Nine fish (20%) were detected on reefs other than the reef onto which they were released. Four patterns of inter-reef movement were identified during the survey, including home range relocations, movements larger than the scale of the study, many inter-reef movements within the study area, and punctual excursions outside the daily home range. The information gathered in this study demonstrates the ability of the fish to carry out medium-scale movements in a fragmented habitat. Consequently, the effectiveness of the reserve to protect the entire population is probably limited for these species.

An alternative is to protect essential habitats, such as spawning grounds, especially if these are stable over time. We studied the movements and habitat use patterns of white trevally Pseudocaranx dentex (Carangidae), a commercially important species, to assist in the design of marine reserves. Diel, seasonal and inter-annual movements of trevally were studied using active acoustic tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-release in the Faial Channel, Azores Islands. White trevally were captured at inshore and offshore reefs. Inshore trevally moved daily alongshore, using large activity spaces, while the short-term movements of offshore trevally were restricted to the reef summits. During the summer spawning season, both groups displayed frequent migrations of up to several kilometres, but inshore fish remained inshore, whereas offshore reef fish expanded their range to include visits to inshore sites. This behaviour eventually resulted in low long-term residence within the study area, especially that of inshore fish. During the spawning season, one inshore site was visited by most of the fish. However, instead of gathering in large aggregations at a single location, it appears that the trevally adopted a multiple-site visiting behaviour, which may increase mating opportunities through mixing between inshore and offshore fish that are otherwise segregated for most of the year. Protection of spawning biomass and sites for this species seems potentially feasible, but this would require protecting a suite of sites per island. Furthermore, because fish would not be fully protected under this scenario, we argue that such spatial management measures need to be accompanied by conventional fishing-effort control measures applied to all local populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  74     Total Times Cited:  91     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3354/meps07946     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Trevally;Acoustic telemetry;Home range;Residency;Spawning aggregation;Marine reserves;REMOTE HAWAIIAN ATOLLS;HOME-RANGE SIZE;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;SITE FIDELITY;CORAL TROUT;CONSERVATION;SERRANIDAE;BEHAVIOR;GROUPER,,

An integrated set of activities was conducted, including tagging and tracking of individuals and underwater video photography to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of movements among neighboring mangrove, seagrass, and coral reef habitats in the northern Florida Keys, USA. Results of ultrasonic acoustic and mini-archival tagging indicated that L. griseus exhibits: (1) a distinct diel migration pattern, whereby shallow seagrass beds; are frequented nocturnally and mangroves and other habitats with complex structure are occupied diurnally, and (2) bay-to-ocean movement, occurring during the known spawning season of L. griseus in this region. Video photography confirmed diel movement among seagrass and mangrove habitats. Results of this subtropical study corroborate direct and indirect evidence obtained in tropical waters of multiple inshore habitat use by L. griseus, as well as its seasonal movement into or towards offshore reefs.

This includes the optimal design of networks of marine reserves, as movements of fish are a major determinant for the reserve effect (increase in size and number inside reserves) and spillover effect (emigration from reserves). The increasing use of acoustic telemetry techniques, particularly passive acoustic arrays, is providing much of that information, but studies have typically used one specific approach at a specific spatial-temporal scale. We studied movement patterns, habitat use and dispersal in the red porgy, Pagrus pagrus (a commercially important species) in the Azores islands, mid-north Atlantic, with the aim of supporting the design of marine reserves that would protect local populations while enhancing fisheries. Movements were quantified using: (1) short-term active acoustic tracking; (2) multi-year passive acoustic monitoring; and (3) standard tag-release experiments in the Faial Channel. We found the short-term home ranges of red porgy to be quite large for a reef fish - up to 50 ha. Further-more, frequent short-term displacements of up to 9 km and periodic absences from main core activity areas indicate that HR varies considerably in size and location throughout the year. Home range expansion occurred mostly during the protracted period of spawning activity, but we saw no evidence for spawning aggregations. We found evidence that individuals of smaller size utilize larger home ranges and are less site-specific, supporting the hypothesis that dispersal in the red porgy is largely determined by ontogenic changes. Large individual variability in both short-term and long-term movement patterns accounted for some emigrations from tagging sites and for one documented relocation. These findings indicate that adequate protection of subpopulations of red porgy will not be achieved using small, isolated reserves (1 to 5 km(2)), but reserves of size in the order of tens of km(2) and spaced a few kilometers apart should provide protection while promoting emigration (spillover) of red porgy from reserves to neighboring grounds. This study shows that the combination of spatial and temporal scales and approaches is needed to capture a realistic picture of the full suite of spatial behaviors used throughout a species' life history.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Mixed techniques",10.1007/978-1-4020-9640-2_25     WE  - Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Pagrus pagrus;Acoustic telemetry;Home range;Residency;Relocation;Spillover;SNAPPER PAGRUS-AURATUS;HOME-RANGE SIZE;SEMICOSSYPHUS-PULCHER LABRIDAE;ADULT CALIFORNIA SHEEPHEAD;SITE FIDELITY;FISH;PATTERNS;POPULATION;SELECTION;SPARIDAE,,

However, to benefit local fisheries through spillover, the species in the reserves must also be able to migrate to unprotected areas. We evaluated the optimal design of marine reserves for protecting and promoting spillover of a commercially important parrotfish, Sparisoma cretense (Linnaeus, 1758), by empirically quantifying short- and long-term movements of individuals originally captured inside and outside a small reserve in the Azores Islands (mid-Atlantic). Movements were quantified using active tracking, passive acoustic monitoring and standard tag-recapture. We found that the dual social organization of the species determined the individuals' movements and habitat use. Haremic fish occupied small HRs associated with permanently established male territories in high energy reef areas. Group (schooling) fish spent most of their time in sheltered reefs but expanded their HRs during the spawning season with daily migrations to the 'territorial' areas. S. cretense HR sizes were considerably larger than those previously reported for tropical parrotfishes. Passive acoustic monitoring indicated very high site fidelity and minimal dispersion for up to 30 mo. This study demonstrates that residency of adult parrotfish can last for years. Several individuals emigrated to the reserve from neighbouring areas and some of them relocated thereafter. We suggest that a network of adequately enforced marine reserves of small to medium size (ca. 1 to 5 km(2)) containing suitable habitat diversity can effectively protect core populations of S. cretense, but benefits to adjacent fisheries through spillover will be limited to the areas adjacent to the reserve boundaries.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  96     Total Times Cited:  110     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3354/meps07272     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),parrotfish;acoustic telemetry;movements;home range;residency;marine reserves;spillover;HOME-RANGE SIZE;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;SPATIAL-PATTERNS;REEF FISH;CONSERVATION;FISHERIES;PISCES,,

Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the movements of a large coral reef top predator (Aprion virescens, Lutjanidae; Hawaiian name 'uku') at five atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument (NWHIMNM) from May 2005 to September 2006. The study atolls were located between 23.8 degrees N, 166.2 degrees W and 28.5 degrees N, 178.3 degrees W, and were separated from their nearest receiver-equipped neighbor by distances ranging from 100 to 478 km. No inter-atoll movements by uku were detected but individuals were seasonally site-attached to core activity areas of up to 12 km in length, and ranged up to 19 km across atolls. Within their core areas, tagged uku exhibited diel and tidal habitat shifts, with the latter resulting in round trips of up to 24 km in 24 h. Seasonal uku migrations resulted in extended winter (October-April) absences from summer (May-September) core activity areas and may be linked to summer spawning. Large MPAs (i.e., entire islands, atolls or banks) would probably be required for full protection of resident populations of adult uku, but such 'island-scale' MPAs will not benefit fisheries unless there is significant larval supply from MPAs to neighboring fished areas, or adult emigration over time scales exceeding the 16-month monitoring period of this study. A mixed management strategy of combining smaller MPAs with conventional measures (e.g., minimum size limits, catch, and effort restrictions) may be the best approach for sustaining uku fisheries. However, this would still require relatively large MPAs (12 km in length) to contain uku short-term (diel and tidal) movements, and seasonal migrations would still take uku beyond the boundaries of MPAs of this size. These fluxes across MPA boundaries could supply fish to fisheries but, if high exploitation rates exist, fishing could eliminate key MPA benefits such as increased numbers of large, highly fecund individuals.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  65     Total Times Cited:  78     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA",10.1007/s00227-007-0647-7     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HOME-RANGE SIZE;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;REEF FISHES;NEW-ZEALAND;PATTERNS;RESERVES;NORTHWESTERN;DISPERSAL;BENEFITS;SNAPPERS,,

We show, using acoustic telemetry, that Nassau groupers Epinephelus striatus exhibit highly synchronised migration to spawning sites, despite their otherwise solitary habits. Reproductive adults leave their individual territories in shallow waters near the winter full moons, and migrate to the same spawning site up to 4 times yr(-1). At the spawning site, a remarkable population-wide depth change occurs within an hour as individuals dive to a maximum depth of 255 m. Our results greatly expand the previously known migration frequency and depth range of this species, and reveal an unexpected yet predictable complexity of adult fish migration between habitats.

We identified Rapture Reef at French Frigate Shoals (FFS) atoll as a spawning site, where giant trevally form seasonal mating aggregations. Giant trevally that use Rapture Reef as their core daytime area live there year-round, whereas those that occupy other areas of FFS migrate to Rapture Reef in the summertime during specific phases of the moon. Although giant trevally were wide-ranging and would require large marine protected areas (e.g. entire atolls or islands) to protect their entire range, core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally could be contained within relatively small marine protected areas. Identification of spawning sites could assist in the establishment of focused marine protected areas that, while quite small in size, could have significant impact in preserving the spawning biomass of this species. Very large marine protected areas are not feasible in most heavily populated areas, hence effective alternative management strategies must be found for this tishery-targeted, wide-ranging top predator. We suggest using a combination of relatively small marine protected areas, to protect core activity areas and spawning sites for giant trevally, and conventional measures such as minimum size or 'slot' limits to further safeguard spawning stocks.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  125     Total Times Cited:  143     Cited Reference Count:  40 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.3354/meps333013     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),top predator;marine protected areas;MPAs;spawning migrations;diel migrations;acoustic monitoring;giant trevally;Caranx ignobilis;Carangidae;HOME-RANGE SIZE;REEF FISHES;NEW-ZEALAND;PATTERNS;RESERVES;NORTHWESTERN;AGGREGATION;DISPERSAL;GOATFISH;SHALLOW,,

Recorded site fidelity was higher among tagged S. taeniopterus than among S. coeruleus and varied considerably among individuals. While the number of fish departures from the receiving zones was varied, the majority of departures for each species were less than 30 min in duration for both species, suggesting that when departures occurred, the fish did not travel far.

Commuters made crepuscular migrations of several hundred meters between daytime foraging areas and nighttime refuge holes. Foraying fish did not partake in crepuscular migrations and utilized refuge holes both day and night. Two bluespine unicornfish were also nocturnally active. There was little direct evidence of dispersal from the reserve but differences in bluespine unicornfish abundance and size among reef habitat zones were consistent with ontogenetic habitat shifts.

Sixteen adult S. pulcher (26-38 cm SL) were surgically fitted with small acoustic transmitters and manually tracked for up to 144 h during multiple, 24-h periods between March 2001 and August 2002 within the Catalina Marine Science Center Marine Life Reserve (33 degrees 26'N; 118 degrees 29'W). A geographic information system was used to calculate home range sizes (95% kernel utilization distributions) and habitat use. Tracking of the first five fish over 24 h confirmed that S. pulcher were strictly diurnal, so the remaining 11 fish were tracked from 1 h before sunrise to 1 h after sunset. Home ranges varied greatly, from 938 to 82,070 m(2), with a mean (+/- SD) of 15,134 +/- 26,007 m(2). Variability in home range sizes among fish was attributed to differences in habitat shape (embayment vs. contiguous coastline) and to natural habitat boundaries (deep, sandy expanses) in adjacent areas within the reserve. There was a significant relationship between fish length and proportion of time spent in different habitats (sand vs. reef). S. pulcher were found within rocky-reef areas 54% of the time, and, within these areas, a greater percentage of daytime was spent in high-relief areas.

Average number of days over which fish were tracked was 21.5 (range 5-51). Home range size of individuals, temporal use of space within the home range, and permeability of MR and habitat boundaries to fish movement were examined. Average minimum home range area of K. sectatrix was not significantly different between Grand Caille (30 514 m(2)) and Petit Piton (39 114 m(2)). However, the shape of home ranges was conspicuously different between the sites and reflected available reef shape, Individual home ranges overlapped strongly with those of other individuals at the same site, and use of space within the home range was generally restricted to a small number of preferred sites. Preferred sites were often shared among individuals and tended to be occupied at a specific time of day, with some sites were preferred in the morning and or afternoon, whilst others preferred during the middle of the day. Fidelity to a single sleeping-shelter site was high at night. MR boundaries over contiguous reef at Grand Caille were frequently crossed with individuals spending, on average, 63% of their time (range 37-94) outside the MR. This demonstrates the need for the MR boundary at this site to be implemented farther offshore to encompass the reef, if the MR is to better protect K sectatrix.

For tropical small-scale fisheries, spatial scales of socially appropriate management are generally small-the median no-take locally managed marine area (LMMA) area throughout the Pacific is less than 1 km(2). This is of particular concern for large coral reef fishes, such as many species of grouper, which migrate to aggregations to spawn. Current data suggest that the catchment areas (i.e. total area from which individuals are drawn) of such aggregations are at spatial scales that preclude effective community-based management with no-take LMMAs. We used acoustic telemetry and tag-returns to examine reproductive migrations and catchment areas of the grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus at a spawning aggregation in Papua New Guinea. Protection of the resultant catchment area of approximately 16 km(2) using a no-take LMMA is socially untenable here and throughout much of the Pacific region. However, we found that spawning migrations were skewed towards shorter distances. Consequently, expanding the current 0.2 km(2) no-take LMMA to 1-2 km(2) would protect approximately 30-50% of the spawning population throughout the non-spawning season. Contrasting with current knowledge, our results demonstrate that species with moderate reproductive migrations can be managed at scales congruous with spatially restricted management tools.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning,Full text checked",10.1098/rsos.150694     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),fish spawning aggregation;Epinephelidae;movement ecology;marine protected areas;acoustic telemetry;marine reserve;MARINE PROTECTED AREAS;BROWN-MARBLED GROUPER;EPINEPHELUS-FUSCOGUTTATUS;REEF;FISHERY;VULNERABILITY;COMANAGEMENT;RECOVERY;MOVEMENT,,

The Nassau Grouper Epinephelus striatus is a Caribbean coral reef fish that displays such spawning aggregations, which have been overfished to the point of threatening the species. Using acoustic telemetry, we examined the size at which Nassau Grouper migrate to spawning aggregations, the timing of migrations, and the distance of migration routes used by Nassau Grouper from within and outside of a large, no-take marine reserve in the central Bahamas. Fish (total n = 19) were tagged in 2004 (n = 6) and 2005 (n = 13) and were tracked for one to four spawning seasons. Fish that were 54 cm TL or greater made spawning migrations, with all but one migrating southward along the shelf edge of Exuma Sound for a distance of 70 km to over 200 km, usually during the December full moon. Fish typically made one migration annually, which lasted from 1 to 3 weeks, with fish remaining at spawning sites for only 1-2 d; however, when the full moon was early in the spawning season, several fish remained away from their home reefs through two lunar cycles or delayed their migrations by a month, and one fish made two migrations. Fish that were migrating for the first time had slower swimming speeds to spawning sites than did experienced fish, but swimming speeds were similar between the two groups during return migrations, suggesting that their migration behavior was learned. Our results demonstrate that spawning migration patterns for this species may be more variable in The Bahamas than at other Caribbean locations. The present findings also have important implications for the management of the species, including increasing the minimum size limit to 54 cm or larger and the use of both marine protected areas and seasonal closures to rebuild the spawning stock.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  24     Total Times Cited:  26     Cited Reference Count:  39 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning",10.1080/19425120.2016.1223233     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS;SOUND PRODUCTION;CAYMAN ISLANDS;REEF FISHES;AGGREGATIONS;PATTERNS;TELEMETRY,,

In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators, but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated. We used results of acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analyses to investigate the diel and seasonal movements of Galapagos sharks Carcharhinus galapagensis and giant trevally Caranx ignobilis captured from a mesophotic reef (depth: 50 to 70 m) at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. All predators associated with mesophotic reefs performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements, diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) and others performing reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the summer spawning periods. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to their variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra- specific competition. Mesophotic reefs may provide some prey to upper level predators but also serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients, particularly from shallow to mesophotic reefs.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  92     Total Times Cited:  101     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Elasmo",10.3354/meps11110     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Acoustic telemetry;Galapagos sharks;Giant trevally;Network analysis;Amino acids;Stable isotopes;Trophic ecology;DIEL VERTICAL MIGRATION;CARCHARHINUS GALAPAGENSIS;TROPHIC ECOLOGY;STABLE-ISOTOPES;SPHYRNA-LEWINI;SHARKS;PATTERNS;NITROGEN;CONNECTIVITY;POSITION,,

Known for forming large spawning aggregations, numbering tens of thousands, they are now listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Recently, the only Nassau grouper spawning aggregation in Puerto Rico was documented at Bajo de Sico, a seamount and seasonally closed marine protected area.Studies elsewhere on the spatio-temporal dynamics of Nassau grouper aggregations have documented how, and how far, fish move from home sites to the spawning site, and have shown the tight link between aggregation formation and the lunar cycle. However, these studies have not evaluated the potential impacts of the reduced spatial extent represented by a seamount, nor have they addressed the impacts of local seasonal protection relative to the size of the closed area and the timing of aggregation formation.Acoustic telemetry was used to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of Nassau grouper spawning aggregation formation at Bajo de Sico. Twenty-six individuals were tagged and tracked over three consecutive spawning seasons.Nassau grouper formed three or four aggregations per season, corresponding to the lunar cycles from January to April. Individuals displayed high visitation rates to the aggregation site: 98% visited at least two peaks per season; 80% visited multiple seasons. The timing of arrival, departure, and residency at the site were significantly different among individuals and lunar months, indicating significant variability in aggregation formation. Nassau grouper occupied a relatively small staging area (2.7 km(2)) and courtship arena (0.67 km(2)) compared with aggregations occurring on continental/insular platforms or large atolls; movements off the seamount may occur but were not detected. Results indicate the current seasonal closure inadequately protects the spawning population on Bajo de Sico and should be extended to the end of June.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Spawning,Full text checked",10.1002/aqc.3994,acoustic telemetry;endangered species;fish spawning aggregations;management;Nassau grouper;Puerto Rico;EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS PISCES;SOUND PRODUCTION;REPRODUCTION;CONSERVATION;MANAGEMENT;SERRANIDAE;MOVEMENTS;ISLANDS,,

Sixty individuals were monitored for up to 12 months in an acoustic array comprising three coral reefs, and variation in space use and movement patterns was observed among 26 individuals. Half of the individuals were recorded only in proximity of one receiver along the reef edge, while the other half were detected at multiple receivers and used horizontal areas of approximately 4 km(2). Periods of non-detection and lower detection frequency at night (chi (1) (2) = 342.157, P < 0.001) indicated individuals may move away from the monitored reef edge to the adjacent sandy habitat, but most movements outside the array remain unknown. Long-distance movement was recorded for one individual, recaptured similar to 160 km from the release location. Generally, no trends in depth use were apparent, L. miniatus inhabited a variety of depths, which were not related to individual size or time of day, yet some effect of month was evident. Variation in movement among adult L. miniatus indicates that while some individuals undergo broader-scale movement, spatial closures that cover individual reefs (> 4 km(2)) could provide protection from fishing for the proportion of the population that displayed high site fidelity and moderate-sized activity spaces (over a period of up to 12 months).","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  31     Total Times Cited:  35     Cited Reference Count:  59 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s00227-014-2497-4     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TROUT PLECTROPOMUS-LEOPARDUS;HOME-RANGE SIZE;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;MARINE RESERVES;SITE FIDELITY;VERTICAL MOVEMENTS;ACOUSTIC RECEIVERS;HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS;HABITAT USE;MIGRATION,,

In this study, patterns of movement and home range for Lethrinus harak and Lethrinus obsoletus were quantified using an array of 33 acoustic receivers that covered approximately three quarters of Piti Marine Reserve in the Pacific island of Guam. This array was designed to ensure extensive overlap of receiver ranges throughout the study area. Eighteen individuals (12 L. harak and 6 L. obsoletus) were surgically implanted with ultrasonic transmitters and passively tracked for 4 months. Both species displayed high site fidelity and had relatively small home ranges. The home ranges of L. harak expanded with increasing body size. Feeding of fish by humans, which was common but restricted to a small area within the study site, had little effect on the distribution of the resident populations. L. harak made nightly spawning migrations within the reserve between full moon and last quarter moon of each lunar cycle, coinciding with a strong ebbing tide.

A 46-year-old MR (Hawaii Marine Laboratory Refuge, 21 degrees 27'35 '' N, 157 degrees 48'15 '' W) in waters off Oahu provided a natural setting to examine these factors with the herbivorous bluespine unicornfish (Naso unicornis) and the invasive rhodophyte, Gracilaria salicornia. We acoustically tracked five unicornfish to quantify their residency and habitat use within the MR, conducted field and laboratory observations to confirm N. unicornis consume G. salicornia, and tested the viability of G. salicornia fragments recovered from unicornfish feces. Unicornfish were resident within the MR where they spent most time in reef crest habitat with occasional, brief forays into reef flat habitat. We confirmed unicornfish consume G. salicornia and found a significant positive correlation between algal canopy height and distance from the reef crest, presumably because grazing intensity is lower in less frequently utilized reef flat habitat. We demonstrated that unicornfish egest viable fragments of G. salicornia that resume vegetative growth after several weeks. We conclude that N. unicornis may act as both a natural control agent and a mobile vector for invasive alien algae.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  48 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Herbivorous fish,Mixed techniques | USER-NOTES: {""Bruna""=>[""Acanthuridae""]}",10.1007/s00227-016-3049-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),HOME-RANGE SIZE;REEF FISHES;MOVEMENT PATTERNS;HABITAT USE;MACROALGAE;AREA;CONSERVATION;ASSEMBLAGES;MANAGEMENT;DISPERSAL,,

This study examines the migratory behavior of adult male Tiger Grouper in Little Cayman, Cayman Islands, to better understand the impacts of aggregation fishing. As part of the Grouper Moon Project, we acoustically tagged ten spawning male Tiger Grouper at the western end of Little Cayman in February 2015. Using a hydrophone array surrounding the island, we tracked the movements of the tagged fish for 13 months. We observed 3 migratory strategies: resident fish (n = 2) that live at the FSA site, neighboring fish (n = 5) that live within 4 km of the site, and commuter fish (n = 3) that travel over 4 km for spawning. Fish began aggregating 2 days before the full moon and left 10-12 days after the full moon, from January to May. Regardless of migratory strategy, all tagged fish that aggregated after February 2015 returned to the west end FSA. However, in January 2016, one fish appeared to attend a different FSA closer to its presumed home territory. Tiger Grouper may establish multiple FSAs around Little Cayman, and males appear to attend FSAs near their home territories. Protracted spawning seasons, FSA site infidelity, and putative FSA catchments should all be considered to ensure sustainable fisheries management for this important species.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning",10.1007/s10641-023-01399-w,Fish spawning aggregation;Tiger Grouper;Reef fish;Spatial ecology;Reproductive biology;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;NASSAU GROUPER;EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;PATTERNS;MOVEMENT;FISHERY,,

Monitoring post-translocation movements and migration provides useful information to inform translocation strategies. Three species of large-bodied fish (Yellowfin Bream Acanthopagrus australis, Luderick Girella tricuspidata, and Tarwhine Rhabdosargus sarba) impounded in a cooling water canal at a power station were translocated into the adjacent estuary (Lake Macquarie, New South Wales). Translocated fish were tagged with acoustic tags ( equipped with accelerometer sensors (providing a relative measure of fish activity) and released on either an artificial reef or a natural reef. In addition, 8 freeranging Yellowfin Bream were captured and tagged on the artificial reef. Fish were tracked throughout Lake Macquarie on a dispersed array of 18 VemcoVR2W receivers, and on the artificial reef using a VR4-UWM Vemco Positioning System, for up to 11 months. Yellowfin Bream and Luderick rapidly migrated back to the power station, whereas Tarwhine remained near the release location. Translocated Yellowfin Bream showed divergent behavioural patterns to free-ranging Yellowfin Bream on the artificial reef, with much higher activity levels, elevated nocturnal activity, and different patterns of habitat usage, possibly reflecting divergent foraging behaviour. This study presents a rare example of non-natal homing to an artificial habitat in several large-bodied marine fish species. The role of low frequency sound in the homing of translocated fish, and factors contributing to the observed behavioural patterns are discussed. The presence of a homing signal which can facilitate return migration may decrease the efficacy of translocation efforts for adult marine fishes; however, these responses are speciesspecific and will require evaluation on a case-by-case basis.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  17     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  68 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1093/icesjms/fsw168     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),electricity generation;fish passage;stock enhancement;artificial reef;acoustic;noise;FRESH-WATER FISH;MULLOWAY ARGYROSOMUS-JAPONICUS;ACOUSTIC TELEMETRY;HABITAT REQUIREMENTS;YELLOWFIN BREAM;DEVICES FADS;MOVEMENT;BEHAVIOR;SOUND;WILD,,

For three sweetlip species (Haemulidae), one snapper species (Lutjanidae) and one surgeonfish species (Acanthuridae), diurnal shelter use was remarkably consistent, with occupation of shelters throughout the day, and under all weather conditions, suggesting that factors other than UV avoidance may be important in driving shelter use.

With the exception of the surgeonfish Acanthurus dussumieri, all fishes returned to the same areas to shelter for the entire study period. Individuals of A. dussumieri, however, failed to return on the night of a severe tropical cyclone. They never reappeared at the shelter sites. The disappearance of this species suggests that A. dussumieri probably forage at night in a different location to the carnivorous haemulids and lutjanids.

Median positional error rates from a reference transmitter were 1-2 m, suggesting fish positions were accurate and precise.

These fish responded from initial distances up to 312 m (mean = 68 m) from traps and spent 4-95% (mean = 35%) of their time within 20 m of traps. Using generalized additive models, we determined that telemetered gray triggerfish were most likely to respond to baited traps when they were initially located close to (<100 m), and down-current from, baited traps. There were substantial differences in gray triggerfish responses and water clarity across the 3 recapture periods, suggesting gray triggerfish use vision, olfaction, and perhaps sound to locate bait.

In the tropical marine fishes known as rabbitfish (Siganidae), half of extant species live in socially monogamous, territorial pairs. It has been assumed that partnerships are for mating, but the reproductive mode of pairing rabbitfish is currently unconfirmed. Using passive acoustic telemetry to track movements of fishes belonging to one such species (Siganus doliatus), we provide the first evidence that paired adult fish undertake highly synchronized migrations with multiple conspecifics on a monthly cycle. All tagged individuals migrated along the same route in three consecutive months and were absent from home territories for 2-3 days just after the new moon. The timing and directionality of migrations suggest that S. doliatus may form spawning aggregations, offering the potential for exposure to multiple reproductive partners. The finding raises fundamental questions about the basis of pairing, mate choice and partnership longevity in this family.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  23 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1098/rsos.150252     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),coral reef fish;pairing;reproduction;social systems;spawning aggregation;SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;REEF;EVOLUTION,,

Over a six month period, we captured 38 wild adult great barracuda (Sphyraena barracuda), a species commonly associated with ciguatera in The Bahamas. We sampled three tissues (i.e., muscle, liver, and blood) and analysed them for the presence of ciguatoxins using a functional in vitro N2A bioassay. Detectable concentrations of ciguatoxins found in the three tissue types ranged from 2.51 to 211.74 pg C-CTX-1 equivalents/g. Blood and liver toxin concentrations were positively correlated (rho = 0.86, P = 0.003), indicating that, for the first time, blood sampling provides a non-lethal method of detecting ciguatoxin in wild fish. Non-lethal blood sampling also presents opportunities to couple this approach with biotelemetry and biologging techniques that enable the study of fish distribution and movement. To demonstrate the potential for linking ciguatoxin occurrence with barracuda spatial ecology, we also present a proof-of-concept case study where blood samples were obtained from 20 fish before releasing them with acoustic transmitters and tracking them in the coastal waters using a fixed acoustic telemetry array covering 44 km(2). Fish that tested positive for CTX may have smaller home ranges than non-toxic fish (median distance travelled, U = 2.21, P = 0.03). Results presented from this study may help identify high risk areas and source-sink dynamics of toxins, potentially reducing the incidence and human health risk of ciguatera fish poisoning. Moreover, development of the non-lethal sampling approach and measurement of ciguatera from blood provide future opportunities to understand the mechanistic relationship between toxins and the spatial ecology of a broad range of marine fish species.

Many papers have recently been published on fish spawning aggregations (FSAs), in which numerous fish migrate to specific sites for spawning, yet little is known about the relationship between individual energetic state and reproductive behaviour. We tested whether the individual energetic state affected the reproductive behaviour in male white-streaked grouper Epinephelus ongus, a species that forms FSAs. Body composition measurement of market specimens suggests that male E. ongus feed less and mainly use their lipid reserves for metabolism and testis development during the spawning season. An integrative analysis of body composition and acoustic telemetry data showed that there is a positive relationship between pre-migration lipid density and duration away from the resident area for migration and reproduction (duration away). These results indicate that fatter males with higher lipid density spent longer periods outside of the resident area, which may enhance the susceptibility of these individuals to intensive fishing pressure at the FSA site. Furthermore, the lipid expenditure during the duration away estimated in this study corresponded well with the energy expenditure for metabolism and testis development estimated through the metabolic theory of ecology, suggesting that we could accurately estimate the energy requirement for reproductive behaviours.

Five fish were tracked on patch reef habitats surrounded by seagrass meadows in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, Florida, May-June 1990. Combined distances and contact time were 2.8 km and 71.5 h, respectively. Total contact times ranged from 6.5 to 17.5 h per individual; three fish exhibited behaviours considered to be dusk/dawn migrations in seven episodes for distances of 130-560 m; five of these episodes were probably related to nocturnal foraging and two were between patch reefs. One individual displaced to seagrass meadow 290 m from its daytime resting patch reef, 'homed' directly back to its capture site within 30 min of release. In Puerto Rico and Florida the majority of contacts were categorized as sedentary or roaming, the latter being meandering movements usually within 100 m of the animal's apparent home within each reef complex. Movements of adult white grunt differed from published accounts of juveniles with respect to timing and frequency; off-reef migrations were initiated at irregular times and did not occur as regularly as those in younger fish, yet the essential character of nocturnal or crepuscular migration was maintained, suggesting that a significant behavioural change takes place with increasing size or maturity.

Historically, the Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus (Bloch, 1792), was an important fishery species throughout its range, but due to spawning aggregation overfishing, it is now rare in many reef ecosystems. In The Bahamas, stocks continue to decline despite the implementation of spawning aggregation protections. While more Nassau grouper spawning aggregations have been reported in The Bahamas than any other country, very few have been validated, and the dynamics of spawning migrations to and from these sites is poorly understood. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to describe, for the first time, Nassau grouper migrations along Andros Island, The Bahamas, which is bordered by one of the longest barrier reefs in the world. We report the likely extirpation of a historically important spawning aggregation and suggest Nassau grouper are migrating to a previously undocumented spawning location. Fish migrated in groups during the January 2015 full moon along the barrier reef shelf edge traveling roundtrip distances of 71.5-260.3 km [(x) over bar = 164.5 (SD 65.7) km, n = 9]. These results are critical to assess the efficacy of current management strategies in The Bahamas. Thus far, all known spaning aggregations have been reported to the scientific community by fishers. Data from our study, however, suggest the presence of a potential spawning aggregation informed by passive telemetry and warrants further investigation.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  23     Total Times Cited:  24     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Spawning,Full text checked",10.5343/bms.2016.1042     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS;SOUND PRODUCTION;REEF FISH;SERRANIDAE;FISHERIES;PISCES,,

Albula vulpes is a species of bonefish that is an economically and culturally important sportfish found throughout the Caribbean and that exhibits genetic connectivity among geographically distant populations. We created ontogenetically relevant biophysical models for bonefish larval dispersal based upon multiple observed spawning events in Abaco, The Bahamas in 2013, 2018, and 2019. Biological parameterizations were informed through active acoustic telemetry, CTD casts, captive larval rearing, and field collections of related albulids and anguillids. Ocean conditions were derived from the Regional Navy Coastal Ocean Model American Seas dataset. Each spawning event was simulated 100 times using the program Ichthyop. Ten-thousand particles were released at observed and putative spawning locations and were allowed to disperse for the full 71-day pelagic larval duration for A. vulpes. Settlement densities in defined settlement zones were assessed along with interactions with oceanographic features. The prevailing Northern dispersal paradigm exhibited strong connectivity with Grand Bahama, the Berry Islands, Andros, and self-recruitment to lower and upper Abaco. Ephemeral gyres and flow direction within Northwest and Northeast Providence Channels were shown to have important roles in larval retention to the Bahamian Archipelago. Larval development environments for larvae settling upon different islands showed few differences and dispersal was closely associated with the thermocline. Settlement patterns informed the suggestion for expansion of conservation parks in Grand Bahama, Abaco, and Andros, and the creation of a parks in Eleuthera and the Berry Islands to protect fisheries. Further observation of spawning events and the creation of biophysical models will help to maximize protection for bonefish spawning locations and nursery habitat, and may help to predict year-class strength for bonefish stocks throughout the Greater Caribbean.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  128 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning,Mixed techniques,Full text checked | USER-NOTES: {""Bruna""=>[""active acoustic telemetry""]}",10.1371/journal.pone.0276528     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),TROPICAL REEF FISH;GULF-OF-CALIFORNIA;BODY CONDITION;COASTAL OCEAN;VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION;WATER TEMPERATURE;BARRIER-REEF;MARINE;AGGREGATIONS;RECRUITMENT,,

The habitat, movements and distribution of blackfin snapper Lutjanus fulvus at a monthly aggregation site in Palau were studied using a combination of instruments and approaches, including active/passive acoustics, time-lapse cameras, an autonomous underwater vehicle, current profilers, and high resolution bathymetry. We found that L. fulvus predictably form a large pre-spawning aggregation of an estimated 15 000 fish in a small zone (10s of m) in a tidally forced channel. The aggregation spans 125 m along the northern channel wall, with the highest densities of fish from 9 to 13 m and <15 m from the wall where current velocities are <0.25 m s(-1). The aggregation occurs within an indent in the channel wall where an abrupt change in bathymetry creates a visible eddy-like feature during outgoing tides. The aggregation forms year-round, for 6 d each moon cycle, starting 1 d before the full moon to 4 d after. During the study, 4 tagged fish returned to the site for 6 consecutive lunar cycles; however, residency times within aggregation periods was similar to 1.5 d on average. Densely aggregated fish were present during the day, but migration patterns of tagged fish revealed regular evening migrations to and from the channel mouth, consistently at the highest tide of the day, a behavior assumed for spawning. These observations reveal some physical processes and biological patterns surrounding the formation and function of fish aggregations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  51 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Spawning,Mixed techniques,Full text checked",10.3354/meps12651     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Spawning aggregation;Fish;Telemetry;Acoustics;AUV;FISH SPAWNING AGGREGATIONS;CORAL-REEF FISH;NASSAU GROUPER;EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS;ISLANDS;BELIZE,,

Here, we adopted a combined approach, integrating restriction-siteassociated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) and acoustic telemetry to establish country-wide demographic structure, diversity and connectivity, and the origins of Nassau grouper using an active fish spawning aggregation (FSA) in the central Bahamas. RAD-seq analysis of 94 Nassau grouper sampled from nine locations in The Bahamas generated a working dataset of 13,241 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Similar levels of genetic diversity were found among sampled locations. Evidence of population sub-structuring across The Bahamas was demonstrated and supported by discriminate analysis of principal components (DAPCs) along with analyses of molecular variance (AMOVAs). Associated acoustic telemetry data indicated Nassau grouper tagged at an active FSA in the central Bahamas during the 2016-2017 spawning season migrated to the Exumas at the conclusion of the spawning period. Telemetry data suggest the likely origins of five individuals, which traveled one-way distances of up to 176 km from the FSA in the central Bahamas to two sites within a no-take marine protected area (MPA). Analyses of high-resolution SNP markers (including candidate loci under selection) illustrated patterns of spatial structure and genetic connectivity not reflected by telemetry data alone. Nassau grouper from Exuma and Long Island appear to have genetic signatures that differ from other islands and from the Hail Mary FSA. Collectively, these findings provide novel information on the intraspecific population dynamics of Nassau grouper within The Bahamian archipelago and within an active FSA.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  20     Cited Reference Count:  110 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: MPA,Spawning,Mixed techniques",10.3389/fmars.2020.00157     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),environmental association tests;fish spawning aggregation;groupers;migration;population genomics;selection;single nucleotide polymorphisms;telemetry;EPINEPHELUS-STRIATUS;SPAWNING AGGREGATION;GENETIC DIVERSITY;REEF FISHES;R-PACKAGE;CONSERVATION;GENOMICS;MANAGEMENT;DISCOVERY;IMPLEMENTATION,,

We opportunistically examined how a hurricane influenced behavior of Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus at an artificial reef complex in the western Gulf of Mexico. Red Snapper had a variety of responses, with some fish emigrating and some remaining on site during Hurricane Harvey-a category 4 storm. Hurricane-induced destruction or alteration of habitat may alter space use behavior of fish. However, caution should be used when interpreting behavior without the inclusion of array performance, which may change due to environmental conditions. Importantly, when acoustic array efficiency was not accounted for in space use analyses, mean kernel utilization distribution (m 3 ) was marginally different among the periods before, during, and after Hurricane Harvey. However, when mean daily array efficiency was included as a covariate, space use among the three periods was not significantly different. Hurricanes can affect the movement and residency of marine species and can be an important driver in the displacement of populations and degradation of habitats, but array efficiency should be incorporated to prevent misinterpreting the behaviors of tagged fish.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  1     Total Times Cited:  1     Cited Reference Count:  55 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Bruna""=>""Included""}",10.1002/mcf2.10220     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),PETROLEUM PLATFORMS;CORAL-REEFS;IMPACTS;DENSITY;HABITAT;DISTURBANCE;DEPLOYMENT;MOVEMENTS;RESIDENCE;DYNAMICS,,
